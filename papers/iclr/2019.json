norm of the added per\nturbation is usually used to measure the similarity between original image and adversarial example. \nHowever, such adversarial attacks perturbing the raw input spaces may fail to capture structural inf\normation hidden in the input.   This work develops a more general attack model,  i.e., the structure\nd attack (StrAttack),  which explores group sparsity in adversarial perturbation by sliding a mask t\nhrough images aiming for extracting key spatial structures.  An ADMM (alternating direction method o\nf multipliers)-based framework is proposed that can split the original problem into a sequence of an\nalytically solvable subproblems and can be generalized to implement other attacking methods. Strong \ngroup sparsity is achieved in adversarial perturbations even with the same level of Lp-norm distorti\non (p\u2208 {1,2,\u221e}) as the state-of-the-art attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StrAttack by ex\ntensive experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. We also show that StrAttack provides b\netter interpretability (i.e., better correspondence with discriminative image regions) through adver\nsarial saliency map (Paper-not et al., 2016b) and class activation map (Zhou et al., 2016).", "cite_num": 0}, "231": {"title": "variance networks: when expectation does not meet your expectations.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url":

To address this issue, we design local and non-local attention blocks to extract features t\nhat capture the long-range dependencies between pixels and pay more attention to the challenging par\nts. Specifically, we design trunk branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention b\nlock. The trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask branches a\nim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with mixed attentions. The local mask branch co\nncentrates on more local structures with convolutional operations, while non-local attention conside\nrs more about long-range dependencies in the whole feature map. Furthermore, we propose residual loc\nal and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network, which further enhance the repres\nentation ability of the network.

Moving Average (MA) com\nputes the time-average of parameters, whereas Exponential Moving Average (EMA) computes an exponenti\nally discounted sum. Whilst MA is known to lead to convergence in bilinear settings, we provide the \n-- to our knowledge -- first theoretical arguments in support of EMA. We show that EMA converges to \nlimit cycles around the equilibrium with vanishing amplitude as the discount parameter approaches on\ne for simple bilinear games and also enhances the stability of general GAN training. We establish ex\nperimentally that both techniques are strikingly effective in the non-convex-concave GAN setting as \nwell. Both improve inception and FID scores on different architectures and for different GAN objecti\nves. We provide comprehensive experimental results across a range of datasets -- mixture of Gaussian\ns, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA and ImageNet -- to demonstrate its effectiveness. We achieve state-of-th\ne-art results on CIFAR-10 and produce clean CelebA face images.\\footnote{~The code is available at \\\nurl{https://github.com/yasinyazici/EMA_GAN}}", "cite_num": 0}, "384":

(2018) is one of the most effective meth\nods to defend against adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs). In our paper, we shed som\ne lights on the practicality and the hardness of adversarial training by showing that the effectiven\ness (robustness on test set) of adversarial training has a strong correlation with the distance betw\neen a test point and the manifold of training data embedded by the network. Test examples that are r\nelatively far away from this manifold are more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Conse\nquentially, an adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks, the \"bli\nnd-spot attack\", where the input images reside in \"blind-spots\" (low density regions) of the empiric\nal distribution of training data but is still on the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found\n that these blind-spots can be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most \nimportantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold (CIFAR, ImageNet, et\nc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training makes defending on any valid test examples \ndifficult due to the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of training data. Additionally, we fin\nd that blind-spots also exist on provable defenses including (Wong & Kolter, 2018) and (Sinha et al.\n, 2018) because these trainable robustness certificates can only be practically optimized on a limit\ned set of training data.", "cite_num": 4}, "11": {"title": "multilingual neural machine translation with soft decoupled encoding.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skeke3C5Fm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "91": {"title": "per-tensor fixed-point quantization of the back-propagation algorithm.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkxaNjA9Ym", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "417": {"title": "generative code modeling with graphs.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bke4KsA5FX", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "392": {"title": "learning to infer and execute 3d shape programs.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=rylNH20qFQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "162": {"title": "verification of non-linear specifications for neural networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyeFAsRctQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "358": {"title": "on self modulation for generative adversarial networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkl5aoR5tm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "99": {"title": "recurrent experience replay in distributed reinforcement learning.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lyTjAqYX", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "438": {"title": "generalized tensor models for recurrent neural networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gNni0qtm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "192": {"title": "autoloss: learning discrete schedule for alternate optimization.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgK6iA5KX", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "426": {"title": "texttovec: deep contextualized neural autoregressive topic models of language with distributed compositional prior.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgoyn09KQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "57": {"title": "neural speed reading with structural-jump-lstm.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1xf9jAqFQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "451": {"title": "towards understanding regularization in batch normalization.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJlLKjR9FQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "440": {"title": "hierarchical generative modeling for controllable speech synthesis.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=rygkk305YQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "254": {"title": "dpsnet: end-to-end deep plane sweep stereo.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryeYHi0ctQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "248": {"title": "spectral inference networks: unifying deep and spectral learning.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzqpj09YQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "498": {"title": "adaptivity of deep relu network for learning in besov and mixed smooth besov spaces: optimal rate and curse of dimensionality.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1ebTsActm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "268": {"title": "lemonade: learned motif and neuronal assembly detection in calcium imaging videos.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkloDjAqYm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "491": {"title": "temporal difference variational auto-encoder.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1x4ghC9tQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "293": {"title": "deep anomaly detection with outlier exposure.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxCxhRcY7", "abstract": "It is important to detect anomalous inputs when deploying machine learning systems.

works have failed to locate dense and in\ntegral regions for each entire action due to the overestimation of the most salient regions. To alle\nviate this issue, we propose a marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) to suppress the domin\nant response of the most salient regions in a principled manner. The MAAN employs a novel marginaliz\ned average aggregation (MAA) module and learns a set of latent discriminative probabilities in an en\nd-to-end fashion.  MAA samples multiple subsets from the video snippet features according to a set o\nf latent discriminative probabilities and takes the expectation over all the averaged subset feature\ns. Theoretically, we prove that the MAA module with learned latent discriminative probabilities succ\nessfully reduces the difference in responses between the most salient regions and the others. Theref\nore, MAAN is able to generate better class activation sequences and identify dense and integral acti\non regions in the videos. Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of construc\nting MAA from $O(2^T)$ to $O(T^2)$. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets show tha\nt our MAAN achieves a superior performance on weakly-supervised temporal action localization.\n      \n  \n        \n        ", "cite_num": 0}, "153": {"title": "knowledge flow: improve upon your teachers.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeOioA9Y7", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "287": {"title": "modeling the long term future in model-based reinforcement learning.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgQBn0cF7", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "342": {"title": "exemplar guided unsupervised image-to-image translation with semantic consistency.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1lTg3RqYQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "72": {"title": "efficient multi-objective neural architecture search via lamarckian evolution.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByME42AqK7", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "163": {"title": "boosting robustness certification of neural networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgeEh09KQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "477": {"title": "learning to navigate the web.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJemQ209FQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "434": {"title": "adaptive gradient methods with dynamic bound of learning rate.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "101": {"title": "towards the first adversarially robust neural network model on mnist.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1EHOsC9tX", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "229": {"title": "quaternion recurrent neural networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByMHvs0cFQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "285": {"title": "feed-forward propagation in probabilistic neural networks with categorical and max layers.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkMuPjRcKQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "236": {"title": "practical lossless compression with latent variables using bits back coding.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryE98iR5tm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "416": {"title": "explaining image classifiers by counterfactual generation.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MXz20cYQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "188": {"title": "latent convolutional models.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGciiR5Y7", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "478": {"title": "invariant and equivariant graph networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syx72jC9tm", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "98": {"title": "improving generalization and stability of generative adversarial networks.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxPYjC5KQ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "90": {"title": "algorithmic framework for model-based deep reinforcement learning with theoretical guarantees.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJe1E2R5KX", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "137": {"title": "learning actionable representations with goal conditioned policies.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hye9lnCct7", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "74": {"title": "posterior attention models for sequence to sequence learning.", "conf": "iclr", "time": "2019", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkltNhC9FX", "abstract": "Modern neural architectures critically rely on attention for mapping structured inputs to sequences.\n In this paper we show that prevalent attention architectures do not adequately model the dependence\n among the attention and output tokens across a predicted sequence.\n        We present an alternativ\ne architecture called  Posterior Attention Models that after a principled factorization of the full \njoint distribution of the attention and output variables, proposes two major changes.
