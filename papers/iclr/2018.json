We propose a new Q\\&A model that do\nes not require recurrent networks: It consists exclusively of attention and convolutions, yet achiev\nes equivalent or better performance than existing models. On the SQuAD dataset, our model is 3x to 1\n3x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference. The speed-up gain allows us to train the mod\nel with much more data. We hence combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neu\nral machine translation model.

RNN can capture long-range dependency\n but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not per\nform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation,\n but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a mode\nl, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)\", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encod\ning. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire\n sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then\n applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, ea\nch SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additi\nonally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and\n use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for dif\nferent NLP tasks, Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better ef\nficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN/CNN/SAN.", "cite_num": 12, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "196": {"title": "routing networks: adaptive selection of non-linear functions for multi-task learning.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry8dvM-R-", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "197": {"title": "wavelet pooling for convolutional neural networks.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkhlb8lCZ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "198": {"title": "fearnet: brain-inspired model for incremental learning.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ1Xmf-Rb", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "199": {"title": "do gans learn the distribution? some theory and empirics.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJehNfW0-", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "200": {"title": "towards reverse-engineering black-box neural networks.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydjJte0-", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "201": {"title": "understanding deep neural networks with rectified linear units.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1J_rgWRW", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "202": {"title": "training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=rytNfI1AZ", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iclr", "time": "2018"}, "203": {"title": "learn to pay attention.", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyzbhfWRW", "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end-trainable attention module for convolutional neural network (CNN) architect\nures built for image classification.

Second, it introduces an improved attention scoring function that better utilizes th\ne \"history of word\" concept. Third, it proposes a fully-aware multi-level attention mechanism to cap\nture the complete information in one text (such as a question) and exploit it in its counterpart (su\nch as context or passage) layer by layer.
