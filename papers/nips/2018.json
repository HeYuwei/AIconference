long-range relations is fundamental to image/video recognition. Existing CNN mod\nels generally rely on increasing depth to model such relations which is highly inefficient. In this \nwork, we propose the \"double attention block\", a novel component that aggregates and propagates info\nrmative global features from the entire spatio-temporal space of input images/videos, enabling subse\nquent convolution layers to access features from the entire space efficiently. The component is desi\ngned with a double attention mechanism in two steps, where the first step gathers features from the \nentire space into a compact set through second-order attention pooling and the second step adaptivel\ny selects and distributes features to each location via another attention. The proposed double atten\ntion block is easy to adopt and can be plugged into existing deep neural networks conveniently. We c\nonduct extensive ablation studies and experiments on both image and video recognition tasks for eval\nuating its performance. On the image recognition task, a ResNet-50 equipped with our double attentio\nn blocks outperforms a much larger ResNet-152 architecture on ImageNet-1k dataset with over 40% less\n the number of parameters and less FLOPs.

However, such a strategy raises one key proble\nm that attention regions will gradually expand to non-object regions as training iterations continue\n, which significantly decreases the quality of the produced attention maps. To tackle such an issue \nas well as promote the quality of object attention, we introduce a simple yet effective Self-Erasing\n Network (SeeNet) to prohibit attentions from spreading to unexpected background regions. In particu\nlar, SeeNet leverages two self-erasing strategies to encourage networks to use reliable object and b\nackground cues for learning to attention. In this way, integral object regions can be effectively hi\nghlighted without including much more background regions. To test the quality of the generated atten\ntion maps, we employ the mined object regions as heuristic cues for learning semantic segmentation m\nodels.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the notion of \ninput-dependent uncertainty to the attention mechanism, such that it generates attention for each fe\nature with varying degrees of noise based on the given input, to learn larger variance on instances \nit is uncertain about. We learn this Uncertainty-aware Attention (UA) mechanism using variational in\nference, and validate it on various risk prediction tasks from electronic health records on which ou\nr model significantly outperforms existing attention models. The analysis of the learned attentions \nshows that our model generates attentions that comply with clinicians' interpretation, and provide r\nicher interpretation via learned variance. Further evaluation of both the accuracy of the uncertaint\ny calibration and the prediction performance with \"I don't know\" decision show that UA yields networ\nks with high reliability as well.",

To solve this problem, co-attention builds two \nseparate attention distributions for each modality neglecting the interaction between multimodal inp\nuts. In this paper, we propose bilinear attention networks (BAN) that find bilinear attention distri\nbutions to utilize given vision-language information seamlessly. BAN considers bilinear interactions\n among two groups of input channels, while low-rank bilinear pooling extracts the joint representati\nons for each pair of channels. Furthermore, we propose a variant of multimodal residual networks to \nexploit eight-attention maps of the BAN efficiently.

recogn\nition, and different attention mechanisms have also been embedded into the LSTM or the convolutional\n LSTM (ConvLSTM) networks. Based on the previous gesture recognition architectures which combine the\n three-dimensional convolution neural network (3DCNN) and ConvLSTM, this paper explores the effects \nof attention mechanism in ConvLSTM. Several variants of ConvLSTM are evaluated: (a) Removing the con\nvolutional structures of the three gates in ConvLSTM, (b) Applying the attention mechanism on the in\nput of ConvLSTM, (c) Reconstructing the input and (d) output gates respectively with the modified ch\nannel-wise attention mechanism. The evaluation results demonstrate that the spatial convolutions in \nthe three gates scarcely contribute to the spatiotemporal feature fusion, and the attention mechanis\nms embedded into the input and output gates cannot improve the feature fusion. In other words, ConvL\nSTM mainly contributes to the temporal fusion along with the recurrent steps to learn the long-term \nspatiotemporal features, when taking as input the spatial or spatiotemporal features. On this basis,\n a new variant of LSTM is derived, in which the convolutional structures are only embedded into the \ninput-to-state transition of LSTM.

To this end, we propose novel Bidirec\ntional Attention Connectors (BAC) for efficiently forging connections throughout the network.

relationships between the v\nisual features and the corresponding class semantic descriptions. However, using the global features\n to represent fine-grained images may lead to sub-optimal results since they neglect the discriminat\nive differences of local regions. Besides, different regions contain distinct discriminative informa\ntion. The important regions should contribute more to the prediction. To this end, we propose a nove\nl stacked semantics-guided attention (S2GA) model to obtain semantic relevant features by using indi\nvidual class semantic features to progressively guide the visual features to generate an attention m\nap for weighting the importance of different local regions. Feeding both the integrated visual featu\nres and the class semantic features into a multi-class classification architecture, the proposed fra\nmework can be trained end-to-end. Extensive experimental results on CUB and NABird datasets show tha\nt the proposed approach has a consistent improvement on both fine-grained zero-shot classification a\nnd retrieval tasks.",

However, informatio\nn sharing among all agents or in predefined communication architectures that existing methods adopt \ncan be problematic. When there is a large number of agents, agents hardly differentiate valuable inf\normation that helps cooperative decision making from globally shared information. Therefore, communi\ncation barely helps, and could even impair the learning of multi-agent cooperation. Predefined commu\nnication architectures, on the other hand, restrict communication among agents and thus restrain pot\nential cooperation. To tackle these difficulties, in this paper, we propose an attentional communica\ntion model that learns when communication is needed and how to integrates shared information for coo\nperative decision making. Our model leads to efficient and effective communication for large-scale m\nulti-agent cooperation. Empirically, we show the strength of our model in various cooperative scenar\nios, where agents are able to develop more coordinated and sophisticated strategies than existing me\nthods.", "cite_num":

types of \nrelational information from the graph. There are many hyper-parameters to these methods (e.g. the le\nngth of a random walk) which have to be manually tuned for every graph. In this paper, we replace pr\neviously fixed hyper-parameters with trainable ones that we automatically learn via backpropagation.\n In particular, we learn a novel attention model on the power series of the transition matrix, which\n guides the random walk to optimize an upstream objective. Unlike previous approaches to attention m\nodels, the method that we propose utilizes attention parameters exclusively on the data itself (e.g.\n on the random walk), and are not used by the model for inference. We experiment on link prediction \ntasks, as we aim to produce embeddings that best-preserve the graph structure, generalizing to unsee\nn information. We improve state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of real world datasets including\n social, collaboration, and biological networks. Adding attention to random walks can reduce the err\nor by 20\\% to 45\\% on datasets we attempted. We show that our learned attention parameters can vary \nsignificantly for different graphs, and correspond to the optimal choice of hyper-parameter if we ma\nnually tune existing methods.",

state-of-the-art models in natural language processing a\nnd related domains. Attention networks are an easy-to-train and effective method for softly simulati\nng alignment; however, the approach does not marginalize over latent alignments in a probabilistic s\nense. This property makes it difficult to compare attention to other alignment approaches, to compos\ne it with probabilistic models, and to perform posterior inference conditioned on observed data. A r\nelated latent approach, hard attention, fixes these issues, but is generally harder to train and les\ns accurate. This work considers variational attention networks, alternatives to soft and hard attent\nion for learning latent variable alignment models, with tighter approximation bounds based on amorti\nzed variational inference. We further propose methods for reducing the variance of gradients to make\n these approaches computationally feasible. Experiments show that for machine translation and visual\n question answering, inefficient exact latent variable models outperform standard neural attention, \nbut these gains go away when using hard attention based training. On the other hand, variational att\nention retains most of the performance gain but with training speed comparable to neural attention.", "cite_num": 8, "conf": "nips", "time": "2018"}, "894":
