A\nn effective interface has the capacity to not only interpret neural signals, but predict the intenti\nons of the human to perform an action in the near future; prediction is made even more challenging o\nutside well-controlled laboratory experiments. This paper describes our approach to detect and to pr\nedict natural human arm movements in the future, a key challenge in brain computer interfacing that \nhas never before been attempted. We introduce the novel Annotated Joints in Long-term ECoG (AJILE) d\nataset; AJILE includes automatically annotated poses of 7 upper body joints for four human subjects \nover 670 total hours (more than 72 million frames), along with the corresponding simultaneously acqu\nired intracranial neural recordings. The size and scope of AJILE greatly exceeds all previous datase\nts with movements and electrocorticography (ECoG), making it possible to take a deep learning approa\nch to movement prediction. We propose a multimodal model that combines deep convolutional neural net\nworks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks, leveraging both ECoG and video modalities. We\n demonstrate that our models are able to detect movements and predict future movements up to 800 mse\nc before movement initiation. Further, our multimodal movement prediction models exhibit resilience \nto simulated ablation of input neural signals. We believe a multimodal approach to natural neural de\ncoding that takes context into account is critical in advancing bioelectronic technologies and human\n neuroscience.", "cite_num": 5}, "1042":

"abstract": "Attention mechanisms have been widely applied in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, as they h\nelp to focus on the area-of-interest of both visual and textual information. To answer the questions\n correctly, the model needs to selectively target different areas of an image, which suggests that a\nn attention-based model may benefit from an explicit attention supervision. In this work, we aim to \naddress the problem of adding attention supervision to VQA models. Since there is a lack of human at\ntention data, we first propose a Human Attention Network (HAN) to generate human-like attention maps\n, training on a recently released dataset called Human ATtention Dataset (VQA-HAT). Then, we apply t\nhe pre-trained HAN on the VQA v2.0 dataset to automatically produce the human-like attention maps fo\nr all image-question pairs. The generated human-like attention map dataset for the VQA v2.0 dataset \nis named as Human-Like ATtention (HLAT) dataset. Finally, we apply human-like attention supervision \nto an attention-based VQA model. The experiments show that adding human-like supervision yields a mo\nre accurate attention together with a better performance, showing a promising future for human-like \nattention supervision in VQA.", "cite_num": 5}, "595": {"title": "merge or not? learning to group faces via imitation learning.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url":

to adversarial exam\nples - a visually indistinguishable adversarial image can easily be crafted to cause a well-trained \nmodel to misclassify. Existing methods for crafting adversarial examples are based on $L_2$ and $L_\\\ninfty$ distortion metrics. However, despite the fact that $L_1$ distortion accounts for the total va\nriation and encourages sparsity in the perturbation, little has been developed for crafting $L_1$-ba\nsed adversarial examples. In this paper, we formulate the process of attacking DNNs via adversarial \nexamples as an elastic-net regularized optimization problem. Our elastic-net attacks to DNNs (EAD) f\neature $L_1$-oriented adversarial examples and include the state-of-the-art $L_2$ attack as a specia\nl case. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that EAD can yield a distinct set o\nf adversarial examples with small $L_1$ distortion and attains similar attack performance to the sta\nte-of-the-art methods in different attack scenarios. More importantly, EAD leads to improved attack \ntransferability and complements adversarial training for DNNs, suggesting novel insights on leveragi\nng $L_1$ distortion in adversarial machine learning and security implications of DNNs.", "cite_num": 77}, "721": {"title": "learning an image-based obstacle detector with automatic acquisition of training data.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16374", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "203": {"title": "\"did i say something wrong?\": towards a safe collaborative chatbot.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16284", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "905": {"title": "axioms for distance-based centralities.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16389", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "423": {"title": "single-peakedness and total unimodularity: new polynomial-time algorithms for multi-winner elections.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16827", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "389": {"title": "a unified model for document-based question answering based on human-like reading strategy.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16084", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "907": {"title": "inference on syntactic and semantic structures for machine comprehension.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16333", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "223": {"title": "model ai assignments 2018.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17449", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "609": {"title": "action schema networks: generalised policies with deep learning.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17207", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "53": {"title": "totsat - totally-ordered hierarchical planning through sat.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16820", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "493": {"title": "distributed composite quantization.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16470", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "870": {"title": "learning mixtures of mlns.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17144", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "216": {"title": "efficient large-scale multi-modal classification.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16166", "abstract": "While the incipient internet was largely text-based, the modern digital world is becoming increasing\nly multi-modal.

However, they are essentially a black box method since it is not easy to mathematically formulate \nthe functions that are learned within its many layers of representation. Realizing this, many resear\nchers have started to design methods to exploit the drawbacks of deep learning based algorithms ques\ntioning their robustness and exposing their singularities. In this paper, we attempt to unravel thre\ne aspects related to the robustness of DNNs for face recognition: (i) assessing the impact of deep a\nrchitectures for face recognition in terms of vulnerabilities to attacks inspired by commonly observ\ned distortions in the real world that are well handled by shallow learning methods along with learni\nng based adversaries; (ii) detecting the singularities by characterizing abnormal filter response be\nhavior in the hidden layers of deep networks; and (iii) making corrections to the processing pipelin\ne to alleviate the problem. Our experimental evaluation using multiple open-source DNN-based face re\ncognition networks, including OpenFace and VGG-Face, and two publicly available databases (MEDS and \nPaSC) demonstrates that the performance of deep learning based face recognition algorithms can suffe\nr greatly in the presence of such distortions. The proposed method is also compared with existing de\ntection algorithms and the results show that it is able to detect the attacks with very high accurac\ny by suitably designing a classifier using the response of the hidden layers in the network.

To overcome this bottleneck, in this paper we introduce the task o\nf multimodal, domain-aware conversations, and propose the MMD benchmark dataset. This dataset was ga\nthered by working in close coordination with large number of domain experts in the retail domain. Th\nese experts suggested various conversations flows and dialog states which are typically seen in mult\nimodal conversations in the fashion domain. Keeping these flows and states in mind, we created a dat\naset consisting of over 150K conversation sessions between shoppers and sales agents, with the help \nof in-house annotators using a semi-automated manually intense iterative process. With this dataset,\n we propose 5 new sub-tasks for multimodal conversations along with their evaluation methodology. We\n also propose two multimodal neural models in the encode-attend-decode paradigm and demonstrate thei\nr performance on two of the sub-tasks, namely text response generation and best image response selec\ntion. These experiments serve to establish baseline performance and open new research directions for\n each of these sub-tasks.

Attention mechanisms have recently attracted\n enormous interest due to their highly parallelizable computation, significantly less training time,\n and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel attention mechanism in which the atten\ntion between elements from input sequence(s) is directional and multi-dimensional (i.e., feature-wis\ne). A light-weight neural net, \"Directional Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)\", is then proposed to lea\nrn sentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention without any RNN/CNN structure.

We use words (language modality), g\nestures (vision modality) and changes in tone (acoustic modality) to convey our intentions. Humans e\nasily process and understand face-to-face communication, however, comprehending this form of communi\ncation remains a significant challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI must understand each mod\nality and the interactions between them that shape human communication. In this paper, we present a \nnovel neural architecture for understanding human communication called the Multi-attention Recurrent\n Network (MARN). The main strength of our model comes from discovering interactions between modaliti\nes through time using a neural component called the Multi-attention Block (MAB) and storing them in \nthe hybrid memory of a recurrent component called the Long-short Term Hybrid Memory (LSTHM). We perf\norm extensive comparisons on six publicly available datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis, spea\nker trait recognition and emotion recognition.

emphasis for predictive\n models that can effectively deal with clinical time-series data. Powered by Recurrent Neural Networ\nk (RNN) architectures with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, deep neural networks have achieved s\ntate-of-the-art results in several clinical prediction tasks. Despite the success of RNNs, its seque\nntial nature prohibits parallelized computing, thus making it inefficient particularly when processi\nng long sequences. Recently, architectures which are based solely on attention mechanisms have shown\n remarkable success in transduction tasks in NLP, while being computationally superior. In this pape\nr, for the first time, we utilize attention models for clinical time-series modeling, thereby dispen\nsing recurrence entirely. We develop the \\textit{SAnD} (Simply Attend and Diagnose) architecture, wh\nich employs a masked, self-attention mechanism, and uses positional encoding and dense interpolation\n strategies for incorporating temporal order. Furthermore, we develop a multi-task variant of \\texti\nt{SAnD} to jointly infer models with multiple diagnosis tasks. Using the recent MIMIC-III benchmark \ndatasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in all tas\nks, outperforming LSTM models and classical baselines with

Regression (CR) based methods have been proposed to solve facial landmarks detection proble\nm, which learn a series of descent directions by multiple cascaded regressors separately trained in \ncoarse and fine stages. They outperform the traditional gradient descent based methods in both accur\nacy and running speed. However, cascaded regression is not robust enough because each regressor's tr\naining data comes from the output of previous regressor. Moreover, training multiple regressors requ\nires lots of computing resources, especially for deep learning based methods. In this paper, we deve\nlop a Self-Iterative Regression (SIR) framework to improve the model efficiency. Only one self-itera\ntive regressor is trained to learn the descent directions for samples from coarse stages to fine sta\nges, and parameters are iteratively updated by the same regressor. Specifically, we proposed Landmar\nks-Attention Network (LAN) as our regressor, which concurrently learns features around each landmark\n and obtains the holistic location increment. By doing so, not only the rest of regressors are remov\ned to simplify the training process, but the number of model parameters is significantly decreased. \nThe experiments demonstrate that with only 3.72M model parameters, our proposed method achieves the \nstate-of-the-art performance.", "cite_num": 3}, "469": {"title": "orthogonal weight normalization: solution to optimization over multiple dependent stiefel manifolds in deep neural networks.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17072", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "962": {"title": "is a picture worth a thousand words? a deep multi-modal architecture for product classification in e-commerce.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16579", "abstract": "Classifying products into categories precisely and efficiently is a major challenge in modern e-comm\nerce.

However, it still remains unclear what properties are encoded in multimodal representations\n, in what aspects do they outperform the single-modality representations, and what happened in the p\nrocess of semantic compositionality in different input modalities. Considering that multimodal model\ns are originally motivated by human concept representations, we assume that correlating multimodal r\nepresentations with brain-based semantics would interpret their inner properties to answer the above\n questions. To that end, we propose simple interpretation methods based on brain-based componential \nsemantics. First we investigate the inner properties of multimodal representations by correlating th\nem with corresponding brain-based property vectors. Then we map the distributed vector space to the \ninterpretable brain-based componential space to explore the inner properties of semantic composition\nality. Ultimately, the present paper sheds light on the fundamental questions of natural language un\nderstanding, such as how to represent the meaning of words and how to combine word meanings into lar\nger units.", "cite_num": 0}, "656": {"title": "facility location games with fractional preferences.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16812", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "9": {"title": "combining rules and ontologies into clopen knowledge bases.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16991", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "697": {"title": "contrastive training for models of information cascades.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17086", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "1053": {"title": "beyond distributive fairness in algorithmic decision making: feature selection for procedurally fair learning.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16523", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "85": {"title": "selective experience replay for lifelong learning.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16054", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "397": {"title": "a new benchmark and evaluation schema for chinese typo detection and correction.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16742", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "537": {"title": "gated-attention architectures for task-oriented language grounding.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17425", "abstract": "To perform tasks specified by natural language instructions, autonomous agents need to extract seman\ntically meaningful representations of language and map it to visual elements and actions in the envi\nronment.

Existing VQA methods mainly adopt the visual attention mechanism to associate the input q\nuestion with corresponding image regions for effective question answering.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep n\neural network for VQA that integrates both attention mechanisms. Our proposed framework effectively \nfuses features from free-form image regions, detection boxes, and question representations via a mul\nti-modal multiplicative feature embedding scheme to jointly attend question-related free-form image \nregions and detection boxes for more accurate question answering.

joint learning attention and recurrent neural network (RNN) models for\n multi-label classification. While approaches based on the use of either model exist (e.g., for the \ntask of image captioning), training such existing network architectures typically require pre-define\nd label sequences. For multi-label classification, it would be desirable to have a robust inference \nprocess, so that the prediction error would not propagate and thus affect the performance. Our propo\nsed model uniquely integrates attention and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, which not only add\nresses the above problem but also allows one to identify visual objects of interests with varying si\nzes without the prior knowledge of particular label ordering. More importantly, label co-occurrence \ninformation can be jointly exploited by our LSTM model. Finally, by advancing the technique of beam \nsearch, prediction of multiple labels can be efficiently achieved by our proposed network model.", "cite_num": -1}, "978": {"title": "modelling iterative

A common way to deal with the user \nmodeling problem is to manually extract all kinds of aggregated features over the heterogeneous beha\nviors, which may fail to fully represent the data itself due to limited human instinct. Recent works\n usually use RNN-based methods to give an overall embedding of a behavior sequence, which then could\n be exploited by the downstream applications. However, this can only preserve very limited informati\non, or aggregated memories of a person. When a downstream application requires to facilitate the mod\neled user features, it may lose the integrity of the specific highly correlated behavior of the user\n, and introduce noises derived from unrelated behaviors. This paper proposes an attention based user\n behavior modeling framework called ATRank, which we mainly use for recommendation tasks. Heterogene\nous user behaviors are considered in our model that we project all types of behaviors into multiple \nlatent semantic spaces, where influence can be made among the behaviors via self-attention. Downstre\nam applications then can use the user behavior vectors via vanilla attention. Experiments show that \nATRank can achieve better performance and faster training process. We further explore ATRank to use \none unified model to predict different types of user behaviors at the same time, showing a comparabl\ne performance with the highly optimized individual models.", "cite_num": -1}, "522": {"title": "tree-structured neural machine for linguistics-aware sentence generation.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16567", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "767": {"title": "a coverage-based utility model for identifying unknown unknowns.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17110", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "1027": {"title": "cross-lingual entity linking for web tables.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16490", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "1072": {"title": "guiding exploratory behaviors for multi-modal grounding of linguistic descriptions.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16512", "abstract": "html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN\"\n\t\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.d\ntd\"", "cite_num": 4}, "511": {"title": "variance reduced k-means clustering.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16108", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "495": {"title": "crm sales prediction using continuous time-evolving classification.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16550", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "736": {"title": "chinese liwc lexicon expansion via hierarchical classification of word embeddings with sememe attention.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16760", "abstract": "html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN\"\n\t\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.d\ntd\"", "cite_num": -1}, "677": {"title": "a parallelizable acceleration framework for packing linear programs.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17118", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "328": {"title": "wasserstein distance guided representation learning for domain adaptation.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17155", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "242": {"title": "deep stereo matching with explicit cost aggregation sub-architecture.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16467", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "980": {"title": "learning interpretable spatial operations in a rich 3d blocks world.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17410", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "408": {"title": "neural ideal point estimation network.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16339", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "915": {"title": "consonant-vowel sequences as subword units for code-mixed languages.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17302", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "358": {"title": "a question-focused multi-factor attention network for question answering.", "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17226", "abstract": "Neural network models recently proposed for question answering (QA) primarily focus on capturing the\n passage-question relation. However, they have minimal capability to link relevant facts distributed\n across multiple sentences which is crucial in achieving deeper understanding, such as performing mu\nlti-sentence reasoning, co-reference resolution, etc. They also do not explicitly focus on the quest\nion and answer type which often plays a critical role in QA. In this paper, we propose a novel end-t\no-end question-focused multi-factor attention network for answer extraction. Multi-factor attentive \nencoding using tensor-based transformation aggregates meaningful facts even when they are located in\n multiple sentences. To implicitly infer the answer type, we also propose a max-attentional question\n aggregation mechanism to encode a question vector based on the important words in a question. Durin\ng prediction, we incorporate sequence-level encoding of the first wh-word and its immediately follow\ning word as an additional source of question type information.

according to a con\nversation context. Existing work has modeled the hierarchy of the context, but does not pay enough a\nttention to the fact that words and utterances in the context are differentially important. As a res\nult, they may lose important information in context and generate irrelevant responses. We propose a \nhierarchical recurrent attention network (HRAN) to model both aspects in a unified framework. In HRA\nN, a hierarchical attention mechanism attends to important parts within and among utterances with wo\nrd level attention and utterance level attention respectively. With the word level attention, hidden\n vectors of a word level encoder are synthesized as utterance vectors and fed to an utterance level \nencoder to construct hidden representations of the context. The hidden vectors of the context are th\nen processed by the utterance level attention and formed as context vectors for decoding the respons\ne. Empirical studies on both automatic evaluation and human judgment show that HRAN can significantl\ny outperform state-of-the-art models for multi-turn response generation.", "cite_num": 21}, "308":

Previous research focus on\n supervised models which depend heavily on training data and manual feature engineering. In this pap\ner, we propose a novel unsupervised framework, namely reduced attentive matching network (RAMN), to \ncompute semantic matching between two questions. Our RAMN integrates together the deep semantic repr\nesentations, the shallow lexical mismatching information and the initial rank produced by an externa\nl search engine. For the first time, we propose attention autoencoders to generate semantic represen\ntations of questions. In addition, we employ lexical mismatching to capture surface matching between\n two questions, which is derived from the importance of each word in a question. We conduct experime\nnts on the open CQA datasets of SemEval-2016 and SemEval-2017.
