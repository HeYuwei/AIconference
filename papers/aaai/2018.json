This problem is called task-oriented language grounding. We propose an end-to-end trainable\n neural architecture for task-oriented language grounding in 3D environments which assumes no prior \nlinguistic or perceptual knowledge and requires only raw pixels from the environment and the natural\n language instruction as input. The proposed model combines the image and text representations using\n a Gated-Attention mechanism and learns a policy to execute the natural language instruction using s\ntandard reinforcement and imitation learning methods. We show the effectiveness of the proposed mode\nl on unseen instructions as well as unseen maps, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also intr\noduce a novel environment based on a 3D game engine to simulate the challenges of task-oriented lang\nuage grounding over a rich set of instructions and environment states.", "cite_num":

for predictive\n models that can effectively deal with clinical time-series data. Powered by Recurrent Neural Networ\nk (RNN) architectures with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, deep neural networks have achieved s\ntate-of-the-art results in several clinical prediction tasks. Despite the success of RNNs, its seque\nntial nature prohibits parallelized computing, thus making it inefficient particularly when processi\nng long sequences. Recently, architectures which are based solely on attention mechanisms have shown\n remarkable success in transduction tasks in NLP, while being computationally superior. In this pape\nr, for the first time, we utilize attention models for clinical time-series modeling, thereby dispen\nsing recurrence entirely. We develop the \\textit{SAnD} (Simply Attend and Diagnose) architecture, wh\nich employs a masked, self-attention mechanism, and uses positional encoding and dense interpolation\n strategies for incorporating temporal order. Furthermore, we develop a multi-task variant of \\texti\nt{SAnD} to jointly infer models with multiple diagnosis tasks. Using the recent MIMIC-III benchmark \ndatasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in all tas\nks, outperforming LSTM models and classical baselines with

A common way to deal with the user \nmodeling problem is to manually extract all kinds of aggregated features over the heterogeneous beha\nviors, which may fail to fully represent the data itself due to limited human instinct. Recent works\n usually use RNN-based methods to give an overall embedding of a behavior sequence, which then could\n be exploited by the downstream applications. However, this can only preserve very limited informati\non, or aggregated memories of a person. When a downstream application requires to facilitate the mod\neled user features, it may lose the integrity of the specific highly correlated behavior of the user\n, and introduce noises derived from unrelated behaviors. This paper proposes an attention based user\n behavior modeling framework called ATRank, which we mainly use for recommendation tasks. Heterogene\nous user behaviors are considered in our model that we project all types of behaviors into multiple \nlatent semantic spaces, where influence can be made among the behaviors via self-attention. Downstre\nam applications then can use the user behavior vectors via vanilla attention. Experiments show that \nATRank can achieve better performance and faster training process. We further explore ATRank to use \none unified model to predict different types of user behaviors at the same time, showing a comparabl\ne performance with the highly optimized individual models.",

Attention mechanisms have recently attracted\n enormous interest due to their highly parallelizable computation, significantly less training time,\n and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel attention mechanism in which the atten\ntion between elements from input sequence(s) is directional and multi-dimensional (i.e., feature-wis\ne). A light-weight neural net, \"Directional Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)\", is then proposed to lea\nrn sentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention without any RNN/CNN structure. DiSAN i\ns only composed of a directional self-attention with temporal order encoded, followed by a multi-dim\nensional attention that compresses the sequence into a vector representation. Despite its simple for\nm, DiSAN outperforms complicated RNN models on both prediction quality and time efficiency. It achie\nves the best test accuracy among all sentence encoding methods and improves the most recent best res\nult by 1.02% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, and shows

Existing work has modeled the hierarchy of the context, but does not pay enough a\nttention to the fact that words and utterances in the context are differentially important. As a res\nult, they may lose important information in context and generate irrelevant responses. We propose a \nhierarchical recurrent attention network (HRAN) to model both aspects in a unified framework. In HRA\nN, a hierarchical attention mechanism attends to important parts within and among utterances with wo\nrd level attention and utterance level attention respectively. With the word level attention, hidden\n vectors of a word level encoder are synthesized as utterance vectors and fed to an utterance level \nencoder to construct hidden representations of the context. The hidden vectors of the context are th\nen processed by the utterance level attention and formed as context vectors for decoding the respons\ne. Empirical studies on both automatic evaluation and human judgment show that HRAN can significantl\ny outperform state-of-the-art models for multi-turn response generation.", "cite_num": 21, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "688": {"title": "how images inspire poems: generating classical chinese poetry from images with memory networks.", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17043", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "689": {"title": "learning multi-modal word representation grounded in visual context.", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16113", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "690": {"title": "memory fusion network for multi-view sequential learning.", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17341", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "691": {"title": "multi-attention recurrent network for human communication comprehension.", "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17390", "abstract": "Human face-to-face communication is a complex multimodal signal.

relation. However, they have minimal capability to link relevant facts distributed\n across multiple sentences which is crucial in achieving deeper understanding, such as performing mu\nlti-sentence reasoning, co-reference resolution, etc. They also do not explicitly focus on the quest\nion and answer type which often plays a critical role in QA. In this paper, we propose a novel end-t\no-end question-focused multi-factor attention network for answer extraction. Multi-factor attentive \nencoding using tensor-based transformation aggregates meaningful facts even when they are located in\n multiple sentences. To implicitly infer the answer type, we also propose a max-attentional question\n aggregation mechanism to encode a question vector based on the important words in a question. Durin\ng prediction, we incorporate sequence-level encoding of the first wh-word and its immediately follow\ning word as an additional source of question type information. Our proposed model achieves significa\nnt improvements over the best prior state-of-the-art results on three large-scale challenging QA dat\nasets, namely NewsQA, TriviaQA, and SearchQA.", "cite_num":

While approaches based on the use of either model exist (e.g., for the \ntask of image captioning), training such existing network architectures typically require pre-define\nd label sequences. For multi-label classification, it would be desirable to have a robust inference \nprocess, so that the prediction error would not propagate and thus affect the performance. Our propo\nsed model uniquely integrates attention and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, which not only add\nresses the above problem but also allows one to identify visual objects of interests with varying si\nzes without the prior knowledge of particular label ordering. More importantly, label co-occurrence \ninformation can be jointly exploited by our LSTM model. Finally, by advancing the technique of beam \nsearch, prediction of multiple labels can be efficiently achieved by our proposed network model.", "cite_num": 8, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "822":

"Cascaded Regression (CR) based methods have been proposed to solve facial landmarks detection proble\nm, which learn a series of descent directions by multiple cascaded regressors separately trained in \ncoarse and fine stages. They outperform the traditional gradient descent based methods in both accur\nacy and running speed. However, cascaded regression is not robust enough because each regressor's tr\naining data comes from the output of previous regressor. Moreover, training multiple regressors requ\nires lots of computing resources, especially for deep learning based methods. In this paper, we deve\nlop a Self-Iterative Regression (SIR) framework to improve the model efficiency. Only one self-itera\ntive regressor is trained to learn the descent directions for samples from coarse stages to fine sta\nges, and parameters are iteratively updated by the same regressor. Specifically, we proposed Landmar\nks-Attention Network (LAN) as our regressor, which concurrently learns features around each landmark\n and obtains the holistic location increment. By doing so, not only the rest of regressors are remov\ned to simplify the training process, but the number of model parameters is significantly decreased. \nThe experiments demonstrate that with only 3.72M model parameters, our proposed method achieves the \nstate-of-the-art performance.", "cite_num": 3, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "848": {"title": "learning adaptive hidden layers for mobile

been widely applied in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, as they h\nelp to focus on the area-of-interest of both visual and textual information. To answer the questions\n correctly, the model needs to selectively target different areas of an image, which suggests that a\nn attention-based model may benefit from an explicit attention supervision. In this work, we aim to \naddress the problem of adding attention supervision to VQA models. Since there is a lack of human at\ntention data, we first propose a Human Attention Network (HAN) to generate human-like attention maps\n, training on a recently released dataset called Human ATtention Dataset (VQA-HAT). Then, we apply t\nhe pre-trained HAN on the VQA v2.0 dataset to automatically produce the human-like attention maps fo\nr all image-question pairs. The generated human-like attention map dataset for the VQA v2.0 dataset \nis named as Human-Like ATtention (HLAT) dataset. Finally, we apply human-like attention supervision \nto an attention-based VQA model. The experiments show that adding human-like supervision yields a mo\nre accurate attention together with a better performance, showing a promising future for human-like \nattention supervision in VQA.", "cite_num": 5, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2018"}, "894": {"title": "ran4iqa: restorative adversarial nets for no-reference image quality assessment.", "url":
