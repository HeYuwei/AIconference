issue for researchers and practitioners in the field of \ntransportation. However, it is very challenging since the traffic flows usually show high nonlineari\nties and complex patterns. Most existing traffic flow prediction methods, lacking abilities of model\ning the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory predic\ntion results. In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional\n network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGCN mainly consists of three i\nndependent components to respectively model three temporal properties of traffic flows, i.e., recent\n, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies. More specifically, each component contains two ma\njor parts: 1) the spatial-temporal attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatialtem\nporal correlations in traffic data; 2) the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs\n graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions to describe the\n temporal features. The output of the three components are weighted fused to generate the final pred\niction results. Experiments on two real-world datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement Sys\ntem (PeMS) demonstrate that the proposed ASTGCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.", "cite_num": 0, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "114": {"title": "deep reinforcement learning for syntactic error repair in student programs.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3882", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "115": {"title": "exploiting sentence embedding for medical question answering.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3883", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "116": {"title": "cash-out user detection based on attributed heterogeneous information network with a hierarchical attention mechanism.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3884", "abstract": "As one of the major frauds in financial services, cash-out fraud is that users pursue cash gains wit\nh illegal or insincere means.

Recently, deep neural networks provided promising solutions for automatic image\n segmentation; however, they often perform good on regular samples (i.e., easy-to-segment samples), \nsince the datasets are dominated by easy and regular samples. For medical images, due to huge inter-\nsubject variations or disease-specific effects on subjects, there exist several difficult-to-segment\n cases that are often overlooked by the previous works. To address this challenge, we propose a diff\niculty-aware deep segmentation network with confidence learning for end-to-end segmentation. The pro\nposed framework has two main contributions: 1) Besides the segmentation network, we also propose a f\nully convolutional adversarial network for confidence learning to provide voxel-wise and region-wise\n confidence information for the segmentation network. We relax the adversarial learning to confidenc\ne learning by decreasing the priority of adversarial learning, so that we can avoid the training imb\nalance between generator and discriminator. 2) We propose a difficulty-aware attention mechanism to \nproperly handle hard samples or hard regions considering structural information, which may go beyond\n the shortcomings of focal loss. We further propose a fusion module to selectively fuse the concaten\nated feature maps in encoder-decoder architectures. Experimental results on clinical and challenge d\natasets show that our proposed network can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.

an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its effectiveness to prepare hi\ngh-dimensional data for many machine learning tasks. The proliferation of high di-mension and huge v\nolume big data, however, has brought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on \nnoisy data, upon existing feature-selection techniques. This paper introduces a novel neural network\n-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based Feature Selec-tion (AFS). AFS consists\n of two detachable modules: an at-tention module for feature weight generation and a learning module\n for the problem modeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features and s\nupervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a shallow attention net for eac\nh feature. Feature weights are generated based on the distribution of respective feature selec-tion \npatterns adjusted by backpropagation during the training process. The detachable structure allows ex\nisting off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less training time, demands\n for the training data and requirements for expertise. A hybrid initialization method is also introd\nuced to boost the selection accuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generati\non. Experimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in comparison to sev\neral state-of-art feature selection algorithms upon both MNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets

annotations, especially in\n biomedical segmentation. Although many semi-supervised methods have been proposed to provide extra \ntraining data, automatically generated labels are usually too noisy to retrain models effectively. I\nn this paper, we propose a Two-Stream Mutual Attention Network (TSMAN) that weakens the influence of\n back-propagated gradients caused by incorrect labels, thereby rendering the network robust to uncle\nan data. The proposed TSMAN consists of two sub-networks that are connected by three types of attent\nion models in different layers. The target of each attention model is to indicate potentially incorr\nect gradients in a certain layer for both sub-networks by analyzing their inferred features using th\ne same input. In order to achieve this purpose, the attention models are designed based on the propa\ngation analysis of noisy gradients at different layers. This allows the attention models to effectiv\nely discover incorrect labels and weaken their influence during the parameter updating process. By e\nxchanging multi-level features within the two-stream architecture, the effects of noisy labels in ea\nch sub-network are reduced by decreasing the updating gradients. Furthermore, a hierarchical distill\nation is developed to provide more reliable pseudo labels for unlabelded data, which further boosts \nthe performance of our retrained TSMAN. The experiments using both the HVSMR 2016 and BRATS 2015 ben\nchmarks demonstrate that our semi-supervised learning framework surpasses the state-of-the-art fully\n-supervised results.", "cite_num":

domain-invari\nant representation that cannot be distinguished by a domain discriminator. Existing methods of adver\nsarial domain adaptation mainly align the global images across the source and target domains. Howeve\nr, it is obvious that not all regions of an image are transferable, while forcefully aligning the un\ntransferable regions may lead to negative transfer. Furthermore, some of the images are significantl\ny dissimilar across domains, resulting in weak image-level transferability. To this end, we present \nTransferable Attention for Domain Adaptation (TADA), focusing our adaptation model on transferable r\negions or images. We implement two types of complementary transferable attention: transferable local\n attention generated by multiple region-level domain discriminators to highlight transferable region\ns, and transferable global attention generated by single image-level domain discriminator to highlig\nht transferable images.

Given the availability of massive training samples, deep metric learning is known to suffer\n from slow convergence due to a large fraction of trivial samples. Therefore, most existing methods \ngenerally resort to sample mining strategies for selecting nontrivial samples to accelerate converge\nnce and improve performance. In this work, we identify two critical limitations of the sample mining\n methods, and provide solutions for both of them. First, previous mining methods assign one binary s\ncore to each sample, i.e., dropping or keeping it, so they only selects a subset of relevant samples\n in a mini-batch. Therefore, we propose a novel sample mining method, called Online Soft Mining (OSM\n), which assigns one continuous score to each sample to make use of all samples in the mini-batch. O\nSM learns extended manifolds that preserve useful intraclass variances by focusing on more similar p\nositives. Second, the existing methods are easily influenced by outliers as they are generally inclu\nded in the mined subset. To address this, we introduce Class-Aware Attention (CAA) that assigns litt\nle attention to abnormal data samples. Furthermore, by combining OSM and CAA, we propose a novel wei\nghted contrastive loss to learn discriminative embeddings. Extensive experiments on two fine-grained\n visual categorisation datasets and two video-based person re-identification benchmarks show that ou\nr method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "cite_num": 4, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "657": {"title": "universal approximation property and equivalence of stochastic computing-based neural networks and binary neural

To this end, we propo\nse self-ensembling attention networks to reduce the domain gap between different datasets. To the be\nst of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt to introduce selfensembling model to d\nomain adaptation for semantic segmentation, which provides a different view on how to learn domain-i\nnvariant features. Besides, since different regions in the image usually correspond to different lev\nels of domain gap, we introduce the attention mechanism into the proposed framework to generate atte\nntion-aware features, which are further utilized to guide the calculation of consistency loss in the\n target domain.

"Cross-domain sentiment classification refers to utilizing useful knowledge in the source domain to h\nelp sentiment classification in the target domain which has few or no labeled data. Most existing me\nthods mainly concentrate on extracting common features between domains. Unfortunately, they cannot f\nully consider the effects of the aspect (e.g., the battery life in reviewing an electronic product) \ninformation of the sentences. In order to better solve this problem, we propose an Interactive Atten\ntion Transfer Network (IATN) for crossdomain sentiment classification. IATN provides an interactive \nattention transfer mechanism, which can better transfer sentiment across domains by incorporating in\nformation of both sentences and aspects. Specifically, IATN comprises two attention networks, one of\n them is to identify the common features between domains through domain classification, and the othe\nr aims to extract information from the aspects by using the common features as a bridge. Then, we co\nnduct interactive attention learning for those two networks so that both the sentences and the aspec\nts can influence the final sentiment representation. Extensive experiments on the Amazon reviews dat\naset and crowdfunding reviews dataset not only demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our\n method, but also give an interpretable way to

In this paper, we retrieve knowledge from exte\nrnal knowledge source to enhance the semantic representation of short texts. We take conceptual info\nrmation as a kind of knowledge and incorporate it into deep neural networks. For the purpose of meas\nuring the importance of knowledge, we introduce attention mechanisms and propose deep Short Text Cla\nssification with Knowledge powered Attention (STCKA). We utilize Concept towards Short Text (CST) at\ntention and Concept towards Concept Set (C-CS) attention to acquire the weight of concepts from two \naspects. And we classify a short text with the help of conceptual information.

Compared with image QA that focuses primaril\ny on understanding the associations between image region-level details and corresponding questions, \nvideo QA requires a model to jointly reason across both spatial and long-range temporal structures o\nf a video as well as text to provide an accurate answer. In this paper, we specifically tackle the p\nroblem of video QA by proposing a Structured Two-stream Attention network, namely STA, to answer a f\nree-form or open-ended natural language question about the content of a given video. First, we infer\n rich longrange temporal structures in videos using our structured segment component and encode text\n features. Then, our structured two-stream attention component simultaneously localizes important vi\nsual instance, reduces the influence of background video and focuses on the relevant text.

Although DS automatically a\nnnotates adequate amounts of data for model training, the coverage of this data is still quite limit\ned, and meanwhile many long-tail relations still suffer from data sparsity. Intuitively, people can \ngrasp new knowledge by learning few instances. We thus provide a different view on RC by formalizing\n RC as a few-shot learning (FSL) problem. However, the current FSL models mainly focus on low-noise \nvision tasks, which makes them hard to directly deal with the diversity and noise of text.

Script event predic\ntion requires to measure the relation between an existing chain and the subsequent event. The domina\nnt approaches either focus on the effects of individual events, or the influence of the chain sequen\nce. However, only considering individual events will lose much semantic relations within the event c\nhain, and only considering the sequence of the chain will introduce much noise. With our observation\ns, both the individual events and the event segments within the chain can facilitate the prediction \nof the subsequent event. This paper develops self attention mechanism to focus on diverse event segm\nents within the chain and the event chain is represented as a set of event segments. We utilize the \nevent-level attention to model the relations between subsequent events and individual events. Then, \nwe propose the chain-level attention to model the relations between subsequent events and event segm\nents within the chain. Finally, we integrate event-level and chain-level attentions to interact with\n the chain to predict what happens next.

Unlike previous stance detection tasks, targets here are not given entitie\ns or claims but entire questions, which makes it difficult to capture the semantics of targets and b\nuild target-dependent representations of answers. To address them, we introduce the Recurrent Condit\nional Attention (RCA) model which incorporates a conditional attention structure into the recurrent \nreading process. RCA iteratively guides the distillation of question semantic with answer informatio\nn and collects stance-oriented text relating to question, further revealing mutual relationship amon\ng stance, answer and question. Experiments on a manually labeled Chinese community QA stance dataset\n show that RCA outperforms four strong baselines by average 2.90% on ", "cite_num": 0, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "912": {"title": "bidirectional transition-based dependency parsing.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4733", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "913": {"title": "drr-net: dynamic re-read network for sentence semantic matching.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4734", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "914": {"title": "a generalized language model in tensor space.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4735", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "915": {"title": "generating chinese ci with designated metrical structure.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4736", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "916": {"title": "a neural network approach to verb phrase ellipsis resolution.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4737", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "917": {"title": "generating character descriptions for automatic summarization of fiction.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4738", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "918": {"title": "multi-labeled relation extraction with attentive capsule network.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4739", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "aaai", "time": "2019"}, "919": {"title": "an affect-rich neural conversational model with biased attention and weighted cross-entropy loss.", "url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4740", "abstract": "Affect conveys important implicit information in human communication. Having the capability to corre\nctly express affect during human-machine conversations is one of the major milestones in artificial \nintelligence. In recent years, extensive research on open-domain neural conversational models has be\nen conducted. However, embedding affect into such models is still under explored. In this paper, we \npropose an end-to-end affect-rich open-domain neural conversational model that produces responses no\nt only appropriate in syntax and semantics, but also with rich affect. Our model extends the Seq2Seq\n model and adopts VAD (Valence, Arousal and Dominance) affective notations to embed each word with a\nffects. In addition, our model considers the effect of negators and intensifiers via a novel affecti\nve attention mechanism, which biases attention towards affect-rich words in input sentences. Lastly,\n we train our model with an affect-incorporated objective function to encourage the generation of af\nfect-rich words in the output responses.

promising improvements \non video captioning. While there is rich information both inside and between frames, spatial attenti\non is rarely explored and motion information is usually handled by 3D-CNNs as just another modality \nfor fusion. On the other hand, researches about human perception suggest that apparent motion can at\ntract attention. Motivated by this, we aim to learn spatial attention on video frames under the guid\nance of motion information for caption generation. We present a novel video captioning framework by \nutilizing Motion Guided Spatial Attention (MGSA). The proposed MGSA exploits the motion between vide\no frames by learning spatial attention from stacked optical flow images with a custom CNN.

Existing works \nmainly focus on designing novel deep architectures to achieve video representations learning for act\nion recognition. Most methods treat sampled frames equally and average all the frame-level predictio\nns at the testing stage. However, within a video, discriminative actions may occur sparsely in a few\n frames and most other frames are irrelevant to the ground truth and may even lead to a wrong predic\ntion. As a result, we think that the strategy of selecting relevant frames would be a further import\nant key to enhance the existing deep learning based action recognition. In this paper, we propose an\n attentionaware sampling method for action recognition, which aims to discard the irrelevant and mis\nleading frames and preserve the most discriminative frames. We formulate the process of mining key f\nrames from videos as a Markov decision process and train the attention agent through deep reinforcem\nent learning without extra labels. The agent takes features and predictions from the baseline model \nas input and generates importance scores for all frames.
