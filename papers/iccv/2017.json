"This paper proposes a novel deep architecture to address multi-label image recognition, a fundamenta\nl and practical task towards general visual understanding. Current solutions for this task usually r\nely on an extra step of extracting hypothesis regions (i.e., region proposals), resulting in redunda\nnt computation and sub-optimal performance. In this work, we achieve the interpretable and contextua\nlized multi-label image classification by developing a recurrent memorized-attention module. This mo\ndule consists of two alternately performed components: i) a spatial transformer layer to locate atte\nntional regions from the convolutional feature maps in a region-proposal-free way and ii) an LSTM (L\nong-Short Term Memory) sub-network to sequentially predict semantic labeling scores on the located r\negions while capturing the global dependencies of these regions. The LSTM also output the parameters\n for computing the spatial transformer. On large-scale benchmarks of multi-label image classificatio\nn (e.g., MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC 07), our approach demonstrates superior performances over other exis\nting state-of-the-arts in both accuracy and efficiency.", "cite_num": 46, "conf": "iccv", "time": "2017"}, "49": {"title": "deep determinantal point process for large-scale multi-label classification", "url":

During training these associations are inferred from image-level caption\ns, akin to weakly-supervised object detector training. These associations help to improve captioning\n by localizing the corresponding regions during testing. We also propose and compare different ways \nof generating attention areas: CNN activation grids, object proposals, and spatial transformers nets\n applied in a convolutional fashion. Spatial transformers give the best results. They allow for imag\ne specific attention areas, and can be trained jointly with the rest of the network.

The contextual info\nrmation of the sentence, as well as visual cues from the video, are important to infer the missing w\nord accurately. Since the source sentence is broken into two fragments: the sentence's left fragment\n (before the blank) and the sentence's right fragment (after the blank), traditional Recurrent Neura\nl Networks cannot encode this structure accurately because of many possible variations of the missin\ng word in terms of the location and type of the word in the source sentence. For example, a missing \nword can be the first word or be in the middle of the sentence and it can be a verb or an adjective.\n In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle the textual encoding: Two separate LSTMs (the LR an\nd RL LSTMs) are employed to encode the left and right sentence fragments and a novel structure is in\ntroduced to combine each fragment with an \"external memory\" corresponding the opposite fragments. Fo\nr the visual encoding, end-to-end spatial and temporal attention models are employed to select discr\niminative visual representations to find the missing word. In the experiments, we demonstrate the su\nperior performance of the proposed method on challenging VFIB problem.

recent advance on \nvision-language understanding. Many seemingly distant annotations (e.g., semantic segmentation and v\nisual question answering (VQA)) are inherently connected in that they reveal different levels and pe\nrspectives of human understandings about the same visual scenes --- and even the same set of images \n(e.g., of COCO). The popularity of COCO correlates those annotations and tasks. Explicitly linking t\nhem up may significantly benefit both individual tasks and the unified vision and language modeling.\n We present the preliminary work of linking the instance segmentations provided by COCO to the quest\nions and answers (QAs) in the VQA dataset, and name the collected links visual questions and segment\nation answers (VQS). They transfer human supervision between the previously separate tasks, offer mo\nre effective leverage to existing problems, and also open the door for new research problems and mod\nels. We study two applications of the VQS data in this paper: supervised attention for VQA and a nov\nel question-focused semantic segmentation task. For the former, we obtain state-of-the-art results o\nn the VQA real multiple-choice task by simply augmenting the multilayer perceptrons with some attent\nion features that are learned using the segmentation-QA links as explicit supervision. To put the la\ntter in perspective, we study two plausible methods and compare them to an oracle method assuming th\nat the instance segmentations are given at the test stage.", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iccv", "time": "2017"}, "190": {"title": "multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling with co-attention learning for visual question answering", "url": "http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Yu_Multi-Modal_Factorized_Bilinear_ICCV_2017_paper.html", "abstract": "Visual question answering (VQA) is challenging because it requires a simultaneous understanding of b\noth the visual content of images and the textual content of questions. The approaches used to repres\nent the images and questions in a fine-grained manner and questions and to fuse these multi-modal fe\natures play key roles in performance. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to outperform tr\naditional linear models for VQA, but their high-dimensional representations and high computational c\nomplexity may seriously limit their applicability in practice. For multi-modal feature fusion, here \nwe develop a Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling approach to efficiently and effectively c\nombine multi-modal features, which results in superior performance for VQA compared with other bilin\near pooling approaches. For fine-grained image and question representation, we develop a co-attentio\nn mechanism using an end-to-end deep network architecture to jointly learn both the image and questi\non attentions. Combining the proposed MFB approach with co-attention learning in a new network archi\ntecture provides a unified model for VQA. Our experimental results demonstrate that the single MFB w\nith co-attention model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the real-world VQA dataset.

problem as a cascade of attention box regression and aesthetic quality c\nlassification, based on deep learning. A neural network is designed that has two branches for predic\nting attention bounding box and analyzing aesthetics, respectively. The predicted attention box is t\nreated as an initial crop window where a set of cropping candidates are generated around it, without\n missing important information. Then, aesthetics assessment is employed to select the final crop as \nthe one with the best aesthetic quality. With our network, cropping candidates share features within\n full-image convolutional feature maps, thus avoiding repeated feature computation and leading to hi\ngher computation efficiency. Via leveraging rich data for attention prediction and aesthetics assess\nment, the proposed method produces high-quality cropping results, even with the limited availability\n of training data for photo cropping. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive results a\nnd fast processing speed (5 fps with all steps).", "cite_num": 18, "conf": "iccv", "time": "2017"}, "229": {"title": "raster-to-vector:

self-driving vehicle\ns. These models need to be explainable - they should provide easy-tointerpret rationales for their b\nehavior - so that passengers, insurance companies, law enforcement, developers etc., can understand \nwhat triggered a particular behavior. Here we explore the use of visual explanations. These explanat\nions take the form of real-time highlighted regions of an image that causally influence the network\u2019\ns output (steering control). Our approach is two-stage. In the first stage, we use a visual attentio\nn model to train a convolution network endto- end from images to steering angle. The attention model\n highlights image regions that potentially influence the network\u2019s output. Some of these are true in\nfluences, but some are spurious. We then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regi\nons actually influence the output. This produces more succinct visual explanations and more accurate\nly exposes the network\u2019s behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three datasets t\notaling 16 hours of driving.

ASD is prevalent, with 1.5% of people in the \nUS. The lack of clinical resources for early diagnoses has been a long-lasting issue. This work diff\nerentiates itself with three unique features: first, the proposed approach is data-driven and free o\nf assumptions, important for new discoveries in understanding ASD as well as other neurodevelopmenta\nl disorders. Second, we concentrate our analyses on the differences in eye movement patterns between\n healthy people and those with ASD. An image selection method based on Fisher scores allows feature \nlearning with the most discriminative contents, leading to efficient and accurate diagnoses. Third, \nwe leverage the recent advances in deep neural networks for both prediction and visualization.

"Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for action recognit\nion in videos. However, previous works mainly utilize video-level category as supervision to train R\nNNs, which may prohibit RNNs to learn complex motion structures along time. In this paper, we propos\ne a recurrent pose-attention network (RPAN) to address this challenge, where we introduce a novel po\nse-attention mechanism to adaptively learn pose-related features at every time-step action predictio\nn of RNNs. More specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. Firstly, unlike previo\nus works on pose-related action recognition, our RPAN is an end-toend recurrent network which can ex\nploit important spatialtemporal evolutions of human pose to assist action recognition in a unified f\nramework. Secondly, instead of learning individual human-joint features separately, our poseattentio\nn mechanism learns robust human-part features by sharing attention parameters partially on the seman\nticallyrelated human joints. These human-part features are then fed into the human-part pooling laye\nr to construct a highlydiscriminative pose-related representation for temporal action modeling. Thir\ndly, one important byproduct of our RPAN is pose estimation in videos, which can be used for coarse \npose annotation in action videos. We evaluate the proposed RPAN quantitatively and qualitatively on \ntwo popular benchmarks, i.e., Sub-JHMDB and PennAction. Experimental results show that RPAN outperfo\nrms the recent state-of-the-art methods on these challenging datasets.", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iccv", "time": "2017"}, "391": {"title": "temporal

sentence generation using recurre\nnt neural networks (RNNs). Recent work has demonstrated the advantages of integrating temporal atten\ntion mechanisms into these models, in which the decoder network predicts each word in the descriptio\nn by selectively giving more weight to encoded features from specific time frames. Such methods typi\ncally use two different types of features: image features (from an object classification model), and\n motion features (from an action recognition model), combined by naive concatenation in the model in\nput. Because different feature modalities may carry task-relevant information at different times, fu\nsing them by naive concatenation may limit the model's ability to dynamically determine the relevanc\ne of each type of feature to different parts of the description. In this paper, we incorporate audio\n features in addition to the image and motion features. To fuse these three modalities, we introduce\n a multimodal attention model that can selectively utilize features from different modalities for ea\nch word in the output description. Combining our new multimodal attention model with standard tempor\nal attention outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two standard datasets: YouTube2Text and MSR-VTT\n.", "cite_num": 46, "conf":

This framework utilizes the merits o\nf single object trackers in adapting appearance models and searching for target in the next frame. S\nimply applying single object tracker for MOT will encounter the problem in computational efficiency \nand drifted results caused by occlusion. Our framework achieves computational efficiency by sharing \nfeatures and using ROI-Pooling to obtain individual features for each target. Some online learned ta\nrget-specific CNN layers are used for adapting the appearance model for each target. In the framewor\nk, we introduce spatial-temporal attention mechanism (STAM) to handle the drift caused by occlusion \nand interaction among targets. The visibility map of the target is learned and used for inferring th\ne spatial attention map. The spatial attention map is then applied to weight the features. Besides, \nthe occlusion status can be estimated from the visibility map, which controls the online updating pr\nocess via weighted loss on training samples with different occlusion statuses in different frames. I\nt can be considered as temporal attention mechanism. The proposed algorithm achieves 34.3% and 46.0%\n in MOTA on challenging MOT15 and MOT16 benchmark dataset respectively.", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "iccv", "time": "2017"}, "508": {"title": "mutual

within a convolutional neural network\n (CNN). This counter-acts the tendency of CNNs to smooth information across regions and increases th\neir spatial precision. To obtain segmentation information, we set up a CNN to provide an embedding s\npace where region co-membership can be estimated based on Euclidean distance. We use these embedding\ns to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron position. We incorporate such masks in \nCNNs and replace the convolution operation with a \"segmentation-aware\" variant that allows a neuron \nto selectively attend to inputs coming from its own region. We call the resulting network a segmenta\ntion-aware CNN because it adapts its filters at each image point according to local segmentation cue\ns. We demonstrate the merit of our method on two widely different dense prediction tasks, that invol\nve classification (semantic segmentation) and regression (optical flow). Our results show that in se\nmantic segmentation we can match the performance of DenseCRFs while being faster and simpler, and in\n optical flow we obtain clearly sharper responses than networks that do not use local attention mask\ns. In both cases, segmentation-aware convolution yields systematic improvements over strong baseline\ns.

The state of the art is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns the mapping b\netween input images and output sequences in a purely data-driven way.

To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose\n the FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention Network) method that employs a focusing attention m\nechanism to automatically draw back the drifted attention. FAN consists of two major components: an \nattention network (AN) that is responsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing meth\nods, and a focusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention by evaluating whether A\nN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images. Furthermore, different from the existin\ng methods, we adopt a ResNet-based network to enrich deep representations of scene text images.

The part classification network further classifies an image by\n each individual part, through which more discriminative fine-grained features can be learned. Two l\nosses are proposed to guide the multi-task learning of channel grouping and part classification, whi\nch encourages MA-CNN to generate more discriminative parts from feature channels and learn better fi\nne-grained features from parts in a mutual reinforced way.
