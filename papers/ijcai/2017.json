This mutual interaction makes attention inferenc\ne a joint optimization with latent intentions. An EM-based approach is adopted to learn the latent i\nntentions and model parameters. Given an RGB-D video with 3D human skeletons, a joint-state dynamic \nprogramming algorithm is utilized to jointly infer the latent intentions, the 3D attention direction\ns, and the attention voxels in scene point clouds.

Conventional methods for cascade predi\nction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models, e.g., independent cascade model and line\nar threshold model. Recently, researchers attempt to circumvent the problem of cascade prediction us\ning sequential models (e.g., recurrent neural network, namely RNN) that do not require knowing the u\nnderlying diffusion model. Existing sequential models employ a chain structure to capture the memory\n effect. However, for cascade prediction, each cascade generally corresponds to a diffusion tree, ca\nusing cross-dependence in cascade---one sharing behavior could be triggered by its non-immediate pre\ndecessor in the memory chain. In this paper, we propose to an attention-based RNN to capture the cro\nss-dependence in cascade. Furthermore, we introduce a \\emph{coverage} strategy to combat the misallo\ncation of attention caused by the memoryless of traditional attention mechanism. Extensive experimen\nts on both synthetic and real world datasets\r\ndemonstrate the proposed models outperform state-of-th\ne-art models at both cascade prediction and inferring diffusion tree.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 11, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "416": {"title": "fast change point detection on dynamic social networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/417", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "417": {"title": "multiple kernel clustering framework with improved kernels.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/418", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "418": {"title": "approximate large-scale multiple kernel k-means using deep neural network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/419", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "419": {"title": "on gleaning knowledge from multiple domains for active learning.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/420", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "420": {"title": "doubly sparsifying network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/421", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "421": {"title": "improving reinforcement learning with confidence-based demonstrations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/422", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "422": {"title": "supervised deep features for software functional clone detection by exploiting lexical and syntactical information in source code.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/423", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "423": {"title": "group-wise deep co-saliency detection.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/424", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "424": {"title": "deep descriptor transforming for image co-localization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/425", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "425": {"title": "learning from demonstrations with high-level side information.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/426", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "426": {"title": "sequential prediction of social media popularity with deep temporal context networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/427", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "427": {"title": "discriminant tensor dictionary learning with neighbor uncorrelation for image set based classification.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/428", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "428": {"title": "unsupervised deep video hashing with balanced rotation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/429", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "429": {"title": "modeling trajectories with recurrent neural networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/430", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "430": {"title": "deep context: a neural language model for large-scale networked documents.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/431", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "431": {"title": "sequence prediction with unlabeled data by reward function learning.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/432", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "432": {"title": "query-driven discovery of anomalous subgraphs in attributed graphs.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/433", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "433": {"title": "dual inference for machine learning.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/434", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017"}, "434": {"title": "attentional factorization machines: learning the weight of feature interactions via attention networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/435", "abstract": "Factorization Machines (FMs) are a supervised learning approach that enhances the linear regression \nmodel by incorporating the second-order feature interactions.

Our work proposes to overcome this difficulty b\ny introducing two learning components: (1) an auxiliary dense character detection task that helps to\n learn text specific visual patterns, (2) an alignment loss that provides guidance to the training o\nf an attention model. We show with experiments that these two components are crucial for achieving f\nast convergence and high classification accuracy for irregular text recognition.

A major difference between stance classification an\nd traditional aspect-level sentiment classification is that the identification of stance is dependen\nt on target which might not be explicitly mentioned in text. This indicates that apart from text con\ntent, the target information is important to stance detection. To this end, we propose a neural netw\nork-based model, which incorporates target-specific information into stance classification by follow\ning a novel attention mechanism. In specific, the attention mechanism is expected to locate the crit\nical parts of text which are related to target.
