This kind of rich network representation presents chal\nlenges for anomaly detection due to the heterogeneity of two data representations. A vast majority o\nf existing algorithms assume certain properties of anomalies are given a prior. Since various types \nof anomalies in real-world attributed networks coexist, the assumption that priori knowledge regardi\nng anomalies is available does not hold. In this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detect\nion in attributed networks generally from a residual analysis perspective, which has been shown to b\ne effective in traditional anomaly detection problems. However, it is a non-trivial task in attribut\ned networks as interactions among instances complicate the residual modeling process.

These works can extract interest\ning patterns, but their assumptions do not guarantee that the derived patterns will match users' pre\nference. On the other hand, their exclusiveness of single modality source misses cross-modality info\nrmation.

In this paper, we argue that both targets and contexts deserve special treatment and need to be \nlearned their own representations via interactive learning. Then, we propose the interactive attenti\non networks (IAN) to interactively learn attentions in the contexts and targets, and generate the re\npresentations for targets and contexts separately.

However, most existing decoders apply the attention mechanism to every generated words including \nboth visual words (e.g., \u201cgun\u201d and \"shooting\u201c) and non-visual words (e.g. \"the\u201c, \"a\u201d).However, these\n non-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without considering visual si\ngnals or attention.Imposing attention mechanism on non-visual words could mislead and decrease the o\nverall performance of video captioning.To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical LSTM with ad\njusted temporal attention (hLSTMat) approach for video captioning. Specifically, the proposed framew\nork utilizes the temporal attention for selecting specific frames to predict related words, while th\ne adjusted temporal attention is for deciding whether to depend on the visual information or the lan\nguage context information. Also, a hierarchical LSTMs is designed to simultaneously consider both lo\nw-level visual information and deep semantic information to support the video caption generation.

"We introduce two tactics, namely the strategically-timed attack and the enchanting attack, to attack\n reinforcement learning agents trained by deep reinforcement learning algorithms using adversarial e\nxamples. In the strategically-timed attack, the adversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by o\nnly attacking the agent at a small subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity \nto this subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a novel method to dete\nrmine when an adversarial example should be crafted and applied. In the enchanting attack, the adver\nsary aims at luring the agent to a designated target state. This is achieved by combining a generati\nve model and a planning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the planni\nng algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the agent. A sequence of adversari\nal examples is then crafted to lure the agent to take the preferred sequence of actions. We apply th\ne proposed tactics to the agents trained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorit\nhm including DQN and A3C. In 5 Atari games, our strategically-timed attack reduces as much reward as\n the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at every time step) does by attacking the agent 4 times less of\nten. Our enchanting attack lures the agent toward designated target states with a more than 70% succ\ness rate.

Existing approaches mine API mappings from projects that have corresponding version\ns in two languages. They rely on the sparse availability of bilingual projects, thus producing a lim\nited number of API mappings. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system called DeepAM for autom\natically mining API mappings from a large-scale code corpus without bilingual projects. The key comp\nonent of DeepAM is based on the multimodal sequence to sequence learning architecture that aims to l\nearn joint semantic representations of bilingual API sequences from big source code data.

task. Analogou\ns to machine translation, we present a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks (RNN) model fo\nr image caption generation. Different from most existing work where the whole image is represented b\ny convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, we propose to represent the input image as a sequence \nof detected objects which feeds as the source sequence of the RNN model. In this way, the sequential\n representation of an image can be naturally translated to a sequence of words, as the target sequen\nce of the RNN model. To represent the image in a sequential way, we extract the objects features in \nthe image and arrange them in a order using convolutional neural networks. To further leverage the v\nisual information from the encoded objects, a sequential attention layer is introduced to selectivel\ny attend to the objects that are related to generate corresponding words in the sentences. Extensive\n experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach on popular benchmark dataset, i.e., MS \nCOCO, and the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in all metrics following the dat\naset splits of previous work. The proposed approach is also evaluated by the evaluation server of MS\n COCO captioning challenge, and achieves very competitive results, e.g., a CIDEr of 1.029 (c5) and 1\n.064 (c40).\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 8}, "541": {"title": "person re-identification by deep joint learning of multi-loss classification.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/305", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "195": {"title": "local topic discovery via boosted ensemble of nonnegative matrix factorization.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/699", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "741": {"title": "fast parallel training of neural language models.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/586", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "683": {"title": "solving very hard problems: cube-and-conquer, a hybrid sat solving method.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/683", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "657": {"title": "an admissible htn planning heuristic.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/68", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "337": {"title": "end-to-end prediction of buffer overruns from raw source code via neural memory networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/214", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "410": {"title": "modal consistency based pre-trained multi-model reuse.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/459", "abstract": "Multi-Model Reuse is one of the prominent problems in Learnware [Zhou, 2016] framework, while the ma\nin issue of Multi-Model Reuse lies in the final prediction acquisition from the responses of multipl\ne pre-trained models.

This configuration is \ncloser to the real applications where the reliability of each model cannot be evaluated properly. In\n this paper, aiming at the lack of evaluation on reliability, the potential consistency spread on di\nfferent modalities is utilized. With the consistency of pre-trained models on different modalities, \nwe propose a Pre-trained Multi-Model Reuse approach (PM2R) with multi-modal data, which realizes the\n reusability of multiple models. PM2R can combine pre-trained multi-models efficiently without re-tr\naining, and consequently no more training data storage is required.

The main tech\nnical challenge is that few approaches can efficiently model the space of connected subgraphs that a\nre isomorphic to a query graph. We present a novel, efficient approach for optimizing a generic nonl\ninear cost function subject to a query-specific structural constraint.

On the other hand, image emotions can be conveyed b\ny different features, such as semantics and aesthetics.

Conventional methods for cascade predi\nction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models, e.g., independent cascade model and line\nar threshold model. Recently, researchers attempt to circumvent the problem of cascade prediction us\ning sequential models (e.g., recurrent neural network, namely RNN) that do not require knowing the u\nnderlying diffusion model. Existing sequential models employ a chain structure to capture the memory\n effect. However, for cascade prediction, each cascade generally corresponds to a diffusion tree, ca\nusing cross-dependence in cascade---one sharing behavior could be triggered by its non-immediate pre\ndecessor in the memory chain. In this paper, we propose to an attention-based RNN to capture the cro\nss-dependence in cascade. Furthermore, we introduce a \\emph{coverage} strategy to combat the misallo\ncation of attention caused by the memoryless of traditional attention mechanism.

To solve this problem, we propose a \nmethod called multimodal linear discriminant analysis (MLDA).

Then in each class, data points which share the sam\ne or similar instance-specific class means are considered to form one cluster or modal. In order to \nlearn the instance-specific class means, we use the ratio of the proposed generalized between-class \nscatter measure over the proposed generalized within-class scatter measure, which encourages the cla\nss separability, as a criterion. The observation that each class will have a limited number of clust\ners inspires us to use a structural sparse regularizor to control the number of unique instance-spec\nific class means in each class.

Two important aspects of automatic learning are the visual perception an\nd knowledge acquisition.

Many automatic knowledge extraction and recognition methods have\n been widely studied. However, little work focuses on integrating automatic knowledge extraction and\n recognition into a unified framework to enable jointly visual perception and knowledge acquisition.\n To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Track Multimodal Automatic Learning (DTMAL) system, which \nconsists of two components: Hybrid Incremental Learning (HIL) from the vision track and Multimodal K\nnowledge Extraction (MKE) from the knowledge track. HIL can incrementally improve recognition abilit\ny of the system by learning new object samples and new object concepts.

However, the existing visual question answering works only focus on the static image, w\nhich may be ineffectively applied to video question answering due to the temporal dynamics of video \ncontents. In this paper, we consider the problem of open-ended video question answering from the vie\nwpoint of spatio-temporal attentional encoder-decoder learning framework. We propose the hierarchica\nl spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video conte\nnts according to the given question.

Despite effectiveness, FM can be hinde\nred by its modelling of all feature interactions with the same weight, as not all feature interactio\nns are equally useful and predictive. For example, the interactions with useless features may even i\nntroduce noises and adversely degrade the performance. In this work, we improve FM by discriminating\n the importance of different feature interactions. We propose a novel model named Attentional Factor\nization Machine (AFM), which learns the importance of each feature interaction from data via a neura\nl attention network. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness \nof AFM. Empirically, it is shown on regression task AFM betters FM with a $8.6\\%$ relative improveme\nnt, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods Wide&Deep and DeepCross \nwith a much simpler structure and fewer model parameters.

Despite the fact that various NARX models have been devel\noped, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies appropriately and select the relev\nant driving series to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based recur\nrent neural network (DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the first stage, we introduce an input \nattention mechanism to adaptively extract relevant driving series (a.k.a., input features) at each t\nime step by referring to the previous encoder hidden state. In the second stage, we use a temporal a\nttention mechanism to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-st\nage attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can also be easily in\nterpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010 dataset and the NASDAQ 100 Stock datas\net demonstrate that the DA-RNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods for time series prediction.",
