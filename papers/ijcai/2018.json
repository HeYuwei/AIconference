proven to \nbe effective in image captioning, most attribute-based approaches simply predict attributes independ\nently without taking the co-occurrence dependencies among attributes into account. Besides, most att\nention-based captioning models directly leverage the feature map extracted from CNN, in which many f\neatures may be redundant in relation to the image content. In this paper, we focus on training a goo\nd attribute-inference model via the recurrent neural network (RNN) for image captioning, where the c\no-occurrence dependencies among attributes can be maintained. The uniqueness of our inference model \nlies in the usage of a RNN with the visual attention mechanism to \\textit{observe} the image before \ngenerating captions. Additionally, it is noticed that compact and attribute-driven features will be \nmore useful for the attention-based captioning model. To this end, we extract the context feature fo\nr each attribute, and guide the captioning model adaptively attend to these context features. We ver\nify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach over the other captioning approaches \nby conducting massive experiments and comparisons on MS COCO image captioning dataset.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 7}, "729": {"title": "compiling model representations for querying large aboxes in expressive dls.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/234", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "319": {"title": "high-fidelity simulated players for interactive narrative planning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/540", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "728": {"title": "behavioral cloning from observation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/687", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "605": {"title": "cisa: chinese information structure analysis for scientific writing with cross-lingual adversarial learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/853", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "202": {"title": "robust norm emergence by revealing and reasoning about context: socially intelligent agents for enhancing privacy.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/4", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "673": {"title": "transformable convolutional neural network for text classification.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/625", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "843": {"title": "joint posterior revision of nlp annotations via ontological knowledge.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/600", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "398": {"title": "ontology-based data access: a survey.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/777", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "453": {"title": "brain-inspired balanced tuning for spiking neural networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/229", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "539": {"title": "hierarchical active learning with group proportion feedback.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/351", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "280": {"title": "extracting latent beliefs and using epistemic reasoning to tailor a chatbot.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/860", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "178": {"title": "intelligent assistant for elderly.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/845", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "283": {"title": "joint extraction of entities and relations based on a novel graph scheme.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/620", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "592": {"title": "computational approaches for stochastic shortest path on succinct mdps.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/653", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "585": {"title": "smarter response with proactive suggestion: a new generative neural conversation paradigm.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/629", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "424": {"title": "dual conditional gans for face aging and rejuvenation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/125", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "48": {"title": "multi-scale and discriminative part detectors based features for multi-label image classification.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/90", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "320": {"title": "generating thematic chinese poetry using conditional variational autoencoders with hybrid decoders.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/631", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "721": {"title": "mcts-minimax hybrids with state evaluations (extended abstract).", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/782", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "203": {"title": "deterministic binary filters for convolutional neural networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/380", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "423": {"title": "multi-modal circulant fusion for video-to-language and backward.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/143", "abstract": "Multi-modal fusion has been widely involved in focuses of the modern artificial intelligence researc\nh, e.g., from visual content to languages and backward. Common-used multi-modal fusion methods mainl\ny include element-wise product, element-wise sum, or even simply concatenation between different typ\nes of features, which are somewhat straightforward but lack in-depth analysis. Recent studies have s\nhown fully exploiting interactions among elements of multi-modal features will lead to a further per\nformance gain. In this paper, we put forward a new approach of multi-modal fusion, namely Multi-moda\nl Circulant Fusion (MCF). Particularly, after reshaping feature vectors into circulant matrices, we \ndefine two types of interaction operations between vectors and matrices. As each row of the circulan\nt matrix shifts one elements, with newly-defined interaction operations, we almost explore all possi\nble interactions between vectors of different modalities. Moreover, as only regular operations are i\nnvolved and defined a priori, MCF avoids increasing parameters or computational costs for multi-moda\nl fusion. We evaluate MCF with tasks of video captioning and temporal activity localization via lang\nuage (TALL). Experiments on MSVD and MSRVTT show our method obtains the state-of-the-art for video c\naptioning. For TALL, by plugging into MCF, we achieve a performance gain of roughly 4.2% on TACoS.\n\t\n\t    ", "cite_num": 6}, "389": {"title": "aesop: a visual storytelling platform for conversational ai.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/857", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "223": {"title": "learning out-of-vocabulary words in intelligent personal agents.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/599", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "609": {"title": "a wearable device for online and long-term ecg monitoring.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/855", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "53": {"title": "orchestrating a network of mereotopological theories: an abridged report.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/739", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "493": {"title": "attentional image retweet modeling via multi-faceted ranking network learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/442", "abstract": "[if lt IE 9]><script src=\"http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js\"></script><![endif]", "cite_num": 5}, "216": {"title": "improving information extraction from images with learned semantic models.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/724", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "472": {"title": "dynamic fair division problem with general valuations.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/52", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "139": {"title": "interactive, collaborative robots: challenges and opportunities.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/3", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "443": {"title": "reinforced mnemonic reader for machine reading comprehension.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/570", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "301": {"title": "better and faster: knowledge transfer from multiple self-supervised learning tasks via graph distillation for video classification.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/158", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "748": {"title": "virtual-to-real: learning to control in visual semantic segmentation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/682", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "445": {"title": "a novel strategy for active task assignment in crowd labeling.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/213", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "856": {"title": "back to basics: benchmarking canonical evolution strategies for playing atari.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/197", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "43": {"title": "improving entity recommendation with search log and multi-task learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/571", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "757": {"title": "progressive blockwise knowledge distillation for neural network acceleration.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/384", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "837": {"title": "delf: a dual-embedding based deep latent factor model for recommendation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/462", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "46": {"title": "line separation from topographic maps using regional color and spatial information.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/501", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "399": {"title": "non-translational alignment for multi-relational networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/581", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "427": {"title": "planning and learning with stochastic action sets.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/650", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "0": {"title": "glass-box: explaining ai decisions with counterfactual statements through conversation with a voice-enabled virtual assistant.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/865", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "200": {"title": "beyond polarity: interpretable financial sentiment analysis with hierarchical query-driven attention.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/590", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis has played a significant role in financial applications in recent years. The info\nrmational and emotive aspects of news texts may affect the prices, volatilities, volume of trades, a\nnd even potential risks of financial subjects. Previous studies in this field mainly focused on iden\ntifying polarity~(e.g. positive or negative). However, as financial decisions broadly require justif\nications, only plausible polarity cannot provide enough evidence during the decision making processe\ns of humanity. Hence an explainable solution is in urgent demand. In this paper, we present an inter\npretable neural net framework for financial sentiment analysis. First, we design a hierarchical mode\nl to learn the representation of a document from multiple granularities. In addition, we propose a q\nuery-driven attention mechanism to satisfy the unique characteristics of financial documents. With t\nhe domain specified questions provided by the financial analysts, we can discover different spotligh\nts for queries from different aspects.

Co-Attention\n enables the learning of pairwise attentions, i.e., learning to attend based on computing word-level\n affinity scores between two documents. However, text matching problems can exist in either symmetri\ncal or asymmetrical domains. For example, paraphrase identification is a symmetrical task while ques\ntion-answer matching and entailment classification are considered asymmetrical domains. In this pape\nr, we argue that Co-Attention models in asymmetrical domains require different treatment as opposed \nto symmetrical domains, i.e., a concept of word-level directionality should be incorporated while le\narning word-level similarity scores. Hence, the standard inner product in real space commonly adopte\nd in co-attention is not suitable. This paper leverages attractive properties of the complex vector \nspace and proposes a co-attention mechanism based on the complex-valued inner product (Hermitian pro\nducts). Unlike the real dot product, the dot product in complex space is asymmetric because the firs\nt item is conjugated. Aside from modeling and encoding directionality, our proposed approach also en\nhances the representation learning process.

Different users place different importance to these aspects which can be thought of as a preferen\nce/attention weight vector. Most existing recommender systems assume that for an individual, this ve\nctor is the same for all items.  However, this assumption is often invalid, especially when consider\ning a user's interactions with items of diverse characteristics. To tackle this problem, in this pap\ner, we develop a novel aspect-aware recommender model named A$^3$NCF, which can capture the varying \naspect attentions that a user pays to different items. Specifically, we design a new topic model to \nextract user preferences and item characteristics from review texts. They are then used to 1) guide \nthe representation learning of users and items, and 2) capture a user's special attention on each as\npect of the targeted item with an attention network.  Through extensive experiments on several large\n-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art review-aware recomme\nnder systems in the rating prediction task.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": -1}, "438": {"title": "experienced optimization with reusable directional model for hyper-parameter search.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/315", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "192": {"title": "reverse engineering queries in ontology-enriched systems: the case of expressive horn description logic ontologies.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/255", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "851": {"title": "evaluating brush movements for chinese calligraphy: a computer vision based approach.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/146", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "662": {"title": "optimal multi-attribute decision making in social choice problems.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/835", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "254": {"title": "distributed pareto optimization for subset selection.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/207", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "293": {"title": "a model of distributed query computation in client-server scenarios on the semantic web.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/733", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "727": {"title": "simultaneous clustering and ranking from pairwise comparisons.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/215", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "676": {"title": "on a scientific discipline (once) named ai.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/713", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "257": {"title": "hst-lstm: a hierarchical spatial-temporal long-short term memory network for location prediction.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/324", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "391": {"title": "convergence analysis of gradient descent for eigenvector computation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/407", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "852": {"title": "a brand-level ranking system with the customized attention-gru model.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/549", "abstract": "In e-commerce websites like Taobao, brand is playing a more important role in influencing users' dec\nision of click/purchase, partly because users are now attaching more importance to the quality of pr\noducts and brand is an indicator of quality.

essential problem in knowledge extraction. Recently, translation bas\ned embedding models (e.g., TransE) have received increasingly attentions. These methods try to inter\npret the relations among entities as translations from head entity to tail entity and achieve promis\ning performance on knowledge graph completion. Previous researchers attempt to transform the entity \nembedding concerning the given relation for distinguishability. Also, they naturally think the relat\nion-related transforming should reflect attention mechanism, which means it should focus on only a p\nart of the attributes. However, we found previous methods are failed with creating attention mechani\nsm, and the reason is that they ignore the hierarchical routine of human cognition. When predicting \nwhether a relation holds between two entities, people first check the category of entities, then the\ny focus on fined-grained relation-related attributes to make the decision. In other words, the atten\ntion should take effect on entities filtered by the right category.

Another clue is the inform\nation of aspect detection history, and it is distilled from the previous aspect predictions so as to\n leverage the coordinate structure and tagging schema constraints to upgrade the aspect prediction. \nExperimental results over four benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that our framework can outperf\norm all state-of-the-art methods.", "cite_num": 3}, "703": {"title": "impossibility in belief merging (extended abstract).", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/799", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "269": {"title": "deep learning for multi-facility location mechanism design.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/36", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "466": {"title": "stochastic anytime search for bounding marginal map.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/704", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "623": {"title": "causal inference in time series via supervised learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/282", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "433": {"title": "hierarchical graph structure learning for multi-view 3d model retrieval.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/127", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "666": {"title": "machine learning approaches to reduce electrical waste and improve power grid stability.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/839", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "643": {"title": "restricted communication in online multi-robot exploration.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/827", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "273": {"title": "energy-efficient amortized inference with cascaded deep classifiers.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/302", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "100": {"title": "reasoning about betweenness and rcc8 constraints in qualitative conceptual spaces.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/271", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "857": {"title": "learning explanatory rules from noisy data (extended abstract).", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/792", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "552": {"title": "learning to explain ambiguous headlines of online news.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/588", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "177": {"title": "distributing frank-wolfe via map-reduce.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/748", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "796": {"title": "predcnn: predictive learning with cascade convolutions.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/408", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "414": {"title": "approximating word ranking and negative sampling for word embedding.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/569", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "292": {"title": "geoman: multi-level attention networks for geo-sensory time series prediction.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/476", "abstract": "Numerous sensors have been deployed in different geospatial locations to continuously and cooperativ\nely monitor the surrounding environment, such as the air quality.

the seamless integration of networ\nk structure information and attribute information. A vast majority of existing works are mainly base\nd on the Homophily assumption that implies the nodal attribute similarity of connected nodes. Noneth\neless, this assumption is untenable in practice as the existence of noisy and structurally irrelevan\nt attributes may adversely affect the anomaly detection performance. Despite the fact that recent at\ntempts perform subspace selection to address this issue, these algorithms treat subspace selection a\nnd anomaly detection as two separate steps which often leads to suboptimal solutions. In this paper,\n we investigate how to fuse attribute and network structure information more synergistically to avoi\nd the adverse effects brought by noisy and structurally irrelevant attributes. Methodologically, we \npropose a novel joint framework to conduct attribute selection and anomaly detection as a whole base\nd on CUR decomposition and residual analysis. By filtering out noisy and irrelevant node attributes,\n we perform anomaly detection with the remaining representative attributes. Experimental results on \nboth synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\t\t  \n  ", "cite_num": 3}, "245": {"title": "multi-modal sentence

Our method is unsup\nervised in the sense that it does not require any training data in the form of object masks but mere\nly a set of images jointly covering objects of a specific class. Our method comprises two collaborat\nive CNN modules, a feature extractor and a co-attention map generator. The former module extracts th\ne features of the estimated objects and backgrounds, and is derived based on the proposed co-attenti\non loss which minimizes inter-image object discrepancy while maximizing intra-image figure-ground se\nparation. The latter module is learned to generated co-attention maps by which the estimated figure-\nground segmentation can better fit the former module. Besides, the co-attention loss, the mask loss \nis developed to retain the whole objects and remove noises.

Question Answering (VQA) has achieved great success by utilizing qu\nestion to selectively target different visual areas that are related to the answer. Existing visual \nattention models are generally planar, i.e., different channels of the last conv-layer feature map o\nf an image share the same weight. This conflicts with the attention mechanism because CNN features a\nre naturally spatial and channel-wise. Also, visual attention models are usually conducted on pixel-\nlevel, which may cause region discontinuous problem. In this paper we propose a Cubic Visual Attenti\non (CVA) model by successfully applying a novel channel and spatial attention on object regions to i\nmprove VQA task. Specifically, instead of attending to pixels, we first take advantage of the object\n proposal networks to generate a set of object candidates and extract their associated conv features\n. Then, we utilize the question to guide channel attention and spatial attention calculation based o\nn the con-layer feature map. Finally, the attended visual features and the question are combined to \ninfer the answer. We assess the performance of our proposed CVA on three public image QA datasets, i\nncluding COCO-QA, VQA and Visual7W. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly\n outperforms the state-of-the-arts.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 4}, "461": {"title": "combinatorial pure exploration with continuous and

To alleviate these issu\nes, we propose a novel key-value memory-augmented attention model for NMT, called KVMEMATT. Specific\nally, we maintain a timely updated keymemory to keep track of attention history and a fixed value-me\nmory to store the representation of source sentence throughout the whole translation process. Via no\nntrivial transformations and iterative interactions between the two memories, the decoder focuses on\n more appropriate source word(s) for predicting the next target word at each decoding step, therefor\ne can improve the adequacy of translations.

variations of skele\nton joints, and remains challenging for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we propose a\n temporal-then-spatial recalibration scheme to alleviate such complex variations, resulting in an en\nd-to-end Memory Attention Networks (MANs) which consist of a Temporal Attention Recalibration Module\n (TARM) and a Spatio-Temporal Convolution Module (STCM). Specifically, the TARM is deployed in a res\nidual learning module that employs a novel attention learning network to recalibrate the temporal at\ntention of frames in a skeleton sequence. The STCM treats the attention calibrated skeleton joint se\nquences as images and leverages the Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to further model the spatial \nand temporal information of skeleton data. These two modules (TARM and STCM) seamlessly form a singl\ne network architecture that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. MANs significantly boost the pe\nrformance of skeleton-based action recognition and achieve the best results on four challenging benc\nhmark datasets: NTU RGB+D, HDM05, SYSU-3D and UT-Kinect.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 5}, "137": {"title": "estimating latent people flow without tracking individuals.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/494", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "24": {"title": "r\u00b3net: recurrent residual refinement network for saliency detection.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/95", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "587": {"title": "curriculum learning for natural answer generation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/587", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "818": {"title": "similarity-based reasoning, raven's matrices, and general intelligence.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/218", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "246": {"title": "rethinking diversified and discriminative proposal generation for visual grounding.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/155", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "485": {"title": "image-level to pixel-wise labeling: from theory to practice.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/129", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "331": {"title": "cross-media multi-level alignment with relation attention network.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/124", "abstract": "With the rapid growth of multimedia data, such as image and text, it is a highly challenging problem\n to effectively correlate and retrieve the data of different media types. Naturally, when correlatin\ng an image with textual description, people focus on not only the alignment between discriminative i\nmage regions and key words, but also the relations lying in the visual and textual context. Relation\n understanding is essential for cross-media correlation learning, which is ignored by prior cross-me\ndia retrieval works. To address the above issue, we propose Cross-media Relation Attention Network (\nCRAN) with multi-level alignment. First, we propose visual-language relation attention model to expl\nore both fine-grained patches and their relations of different media types. We aim to not only explo\nit cross-media fine-grained local information, but also capture the intrinsic relation information, \nwhich can provide complementary hints for correlation learning. Second, we propose cross-media multi\n-level alignment to explore global, local and relation alignments across different media types, whic\nh can mutually boost to learn more precise cross-media correlation. We conduct experiments on 2 cros\ns-media datasets, and compare with 10 state-of-the-art methods to verify the effectiveness of propos\ned approach.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 1}, "81": {"title":
