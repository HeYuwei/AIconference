fact that attribute-based approaches and attention-based approaches have been proven to \nbe effective in image captioning, most attribute-based approaches simply predict attributes independ\nently without taking the co-occurrence dependencies among attributes into account. Besides, most att\nention-based captioning models directly leverage the feature map extracted from CNN, in which many f\neatures may be redundant in relation to the image content. In this paper, we focus on training a goo\nd attribute-inference model via the recurrent neural network (RNN) for image captioning, where the c\no-occurrence dependencies among attributes can be maintained. The uniqueness of our inference model \nlies in the usage of a RNN with the visual attention mechanism to \\textit{observe} the image before \ngenerating captions. Additionally, it is noticed that compact and attribute-driven features will be \nmore useful for the attention-based captioning model. To this end, we extract the context feature fo\nr each attribute, and guide the captioning model adaptively attend to these context features. We ver\nify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach over the other captioning approaches \nby conducting massive experiments and comparisons on MS COCO image captioning dataset.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 7, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "84": {"title": "learning deep unsupervised binary codes for image retrieval.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/85", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "85": {"title": "deep view-aware metric learning for person re-identification.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/86", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "86": {"title": "knowledge-embedded representation learning for fine-grained image recognition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/87", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "87": {"title": "sharing residual units through collective tensor factorization to improve deep neural networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/88", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "88": {"title": "scanpath prediction for visual attention using ior-roi lstm.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/89", "abstract": "Predicting scanpath when a certain stimulus is presented plays an important role in modeling visual \nattention and search.

Experimental results indicate that the prop\nosed architecture can achieve superior performance in predicting scanpaths.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "89": {"title": "multi-scale and discriminative part detectors based features for multi-label image classification.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/90", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "90": {"title": "anonymizing k facial attributes via adversarial perturbations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/91", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "91": {"title": "dual adversarial networks for zero-shot cross-media retrieval.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/92", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "92": {"title": "siamese cnn-bilstm architecture for 3d shape representation learning.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/93", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "93": {"title": "cross-modality person re-identification with generative adversarial training.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/94", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "94": {"title": "r\u00b3net: recurrent residual refinement network for saliency detection.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/95", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "95": {"title": "unsupervised cross-modality domain adaptation of convnets for biomedical image segmentations with adversarial loss.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/96", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "96": {"title": "enhanced-alignment measure for binary foreground map evaluation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/97", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "97": {"title": "watching a small portion could be as good as watching all: towards efficient video classification.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/98", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "98": {"title": "age estimation using expectation of label distribution learning.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/99", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "99": {"title": "coarse-to-fine image co-segmentation with intra and inter rank constraints.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/100", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "100": {"title": "view-volume network for semantic scene completion from a single depth image.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/101", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "101": {"title": "harnessing synthesized abstraction images to improve facial attribute recognition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/102", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "102": {"title": "stackdrl: stacked deep reinforcement learning for fine-grained visual categorization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/103", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "103": {"title": "co-attention cnns for unsupervised object co-segmentation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/104", "abstract": "Object co-segmentation aims to segment the common objects in images.

The latter module is learned to generated co-attention maps by which the estimated figure-\nground segmentation can better fit the former module. Besides, the co-attention loss, the mask loss \nis developed to retain the whole objects and remove noises.

Naturally, when correlatin\ng an image with textual description, people focus on not only the alignment between discriminative i\nmage regions and key words, but also the relations lying in the visual and textual context. Relation\n understanding is essential for cross-media correlation learning, which is ignored by prior cross-me\ndia retrieval works. To address the above issue, we propose Cross-media Relation Attention Network (\nCRAN) with multi-level alignment. First, we propose visual-language relation attention model to expl\nore both fine-grained patches and their relations of different media types. We aim to not only explo\nit cross-media fine-grained local information, but also capture the intrinsic relation information, \nwhich can provide complementary hints for correlation learning. Second, we propose cross-media multi\n-level alignment to explore global, local and relation alignments across different media types, whic\nh can mutually boost to learn more precise cross-media correlation. We conduct experiments on 2 cros\ns-media datasets, and compare with 10 state-of-the-art methods to verify the effectiveness of propos\ned approach.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "124": {"title": "dual conditional gans for face aging and rejuvenation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/125", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1, "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2018"}, "125": {"title": "from pixels to objects: cubic visual attention for visual question answering.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/126", "abstract": "Recently, attention-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) has achieved great success by utilizing qu\nestion to selectively target different visual areas that are related to the answer. Existing visual \nattention models are generally planar, i.e., different channels of the last conv-layer feature map o\nf an image share the same weight. This conflicts with the attention mechanism because CNN features a\nre naturally spatial and channel-wise. Also, visual attention models are usually conducted on pixel-\nlevel, which may cause region discontinuous problem. In this paper we propose a Cubic Visual Attenti\non (CVA) model by successfully applying a novel channel and spatial attention on object regions to i\nmprove VQA task. Specifically, instead of attending to pixels, we first take advantage of the object\n proposal networks to generate a set of object candidates and extract their associated conv features\n. Then, we utilize the question to guide channel attention and spatial attention calculation based o\nn the con-layer feature map. Finally, the attended visual features and the question are combined to \ninfer the answer. We assess the performance of our proposed CVA on three public image QA datasets, i\nncluding COCO-QA, VQA and Visual7W.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we propose a\n temporal-then-spatial recalibration scheme to alleviate such complex variations, resulting in an en\nd-to-end Memory Attention Networks (MANs) which consist of a Temporal Attention Recalibration Module\n (TARM) and a Spatio-Temporal Convolution Module (STCM). Specifically, the TARM is deployed in a res\nidual learning module that employs a novel attention learning network to recalibrate the temporal at\ntention of frames in a skeleton sequence. The STCM treats the attention calibrated skeleton joint se\nquences as images and leverages the Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to further model the spatial \nand temporal information of skeleton data. These two modules (TARM and STCM) seamlessly form a singl\ne network architecture that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. MANs significantly boost the pe\nrformance of skeleton-based action recognition and achieve the best results on four challenging benc\nhmark datasets: NTU RGB+D, HDM05, SYSU-3D and UT-Kinect.\n\t\t

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved remarkable progress in recent\n years, it still suffers from issues of repeating and dropping translations. To alleviate these issu\nes, we propose a novel key-value memory-augmented attention model for NMT, called KVMEMATT. Specific\nally, we maintain a timely updated keymemory to keep track of attention history and a fixed value-me\nmory to store the representation of source sentence throughout the whole translation process. Via no\nntrivial transformations and iterative interactions between the two memories, the decoder focuses on\n more appropriate source word(s) for predicting the next target word at each decoding step, therefor\ne can improve the adequacy of translations.

In this paper,to improve the a\ndaptability of such classificationmethods across different application contexts, weturn this classif\nication task into a game and applya deep reinforcement learning scheme to dynami-cally deal with com\nplex situations.

This mechanism helps tocapture extra informat\nion from the signal, and canthus significantly improve the discriminative powerof the classifier.

To\n solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (MHAM) for gen\nerative dialog systems, which aims at capturing multiple semantic aspects from the user utterance. F\nurther, a regularizer is formulated to force different attention heads to concentrate on certain asp\nects.

Co-Attention\n enables the learning of pairwise attentions, i.e., learning to attend based on computing word-level\n affinity scores between two documents. However, text matching problems can exist in either symmetri\ncal or asymmetrical domains. For example, paraphrase identification is a symmetrical task while ques\ntion-answer matching and entailment classification are considered asymmetrical domains. In this pape\nr, we argue that Co-Attention models in asymmetrical domains require different treatment as opposed \nto symmetrical domains, i.e., a concept of word-level directionality should be incorporated while le\narning word-level similarity scores. Hence, the standard inner product in real space commonly adopte\nd in co-attention is not suitable. This paper leverages attractive properties of the complex vector \nspace and proposes a co-attention mechanism based on the complex-valued inner product (Hermitian pro\nducts). Unlike the real dot product, the dot product in complex space is asymmetric because the firs\nt item is conjugated. Aside from modeling and encoding directionality, our proposed approach also en\nhances the representation learning process.
