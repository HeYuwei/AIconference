We perform rigorous experimentation w\nith several variants of the DyAt model and demonstrate that the DyAt models indeed learn better repr\nesentations over the entire course of the long term forecast as compared to their counterparts with \nor without traditional attention mechanisms.

Recent stu\ndies have mostly focused on developing deep learning approaches to learn a compact graph embedding, \nupon which classic clustering methods like k-means or spectral clustering algorithms are applied. Th\nese two-step frameworks are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal performance, main\nly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed, i.e., designed for the specific clustering task\n. In this paper, we propose a goal-directed deep learning approach, Deep Attentional Embedded Graph \nClustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the tw\no sides of information in graphs. By employing an attention network to capture the importance of the\n neighboring nodes to a target node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node \ncontent in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product decoder is trained to reco\nnstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels from the graph embedding itself are generated \nto supervise a self-training graph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering resu\nlts.

We propose 3DViewGraph to resol\nve this issue, which learns 3D global features by more effectively aggregating unordered views with \nattention. Specifically, unordered views taken around a shape are regarded as view nodes on a view g\nraph. 3DViewGraph first learns a novel latent semantic mapping to project low-level view features in\nto meaningful latent semantic embeddings in a lower dimensional space, which is spanned by latent se\nmantic patterns. Then, the content and spatial information of each pair of view nodes are encoded by\n a novel spatial pattern correlation, where the correlation is computed among latent semantic patter\nns. Finally, all spatial pattern correlations are integrated with attention weights learned by a nov\nel attention mechanism. This further increases the discriminability of learned features by highlight\ning the unordered view nodes with distinctive characteristics and depressing the ones with appearanc\ne ambiguity.

Health Records (EHRs) is critical to assist cl\ninical decision making. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is an effective model to handle sequential dat\na, such as EHRs, but it encounters two major limitations when applied to EHRs: it is unable to inter\npret the prediction results and it ignores the irregular time intervals between consecutive events. \nTo tackle these limitations, we propose an attention-based time-aware LSTM Networks (ATTAIN), to imp\nrove the interpretability of LSTM and to identify the critical previous events for current diagnosis\n by modeling the inherent time irregularity. We validate ATTAIN on modeling the progression of an ex\ntremely challenging disease, septic shock, by using real-world EHRs. Our results demonstrate that th\ne proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as RETAIN and T-LSTM.

Recent approaches based on deep neural networks have exhibited potential for producing el\negant detail and are able to take advantage of background information, which gives texture informati\non about missing region in the image. These methods often perform pixel/patch level replacement on t\nhe deep feature maps of missing region and therefore enable the generated content to have similar te\nxture as background region. However, this kind of replacement is a local strategy and often performs\n poorly when the background information is misleading. To this end, in this study, we propose to use\n a multi-scale image contextual attention learning (MUSICAL) strategy that helps to flexibly handle \nricher background information while avoid to misuse of it. However, such strategy may not promising \nin generating context of reasonable style. To address this issue, both of the style loss and the per\nceptual loss are introduced into the proposed method to achieve the style consistency of the generat\ned image. Furthermore, we have also noticed that replacing some of the down sampling layers in the b\naseline network with the stride 1 dilated convolution layers is beneficial for producing sharper and\n fine-detailed results.

retrieval and has been attracting exte\nnsive attention recently. Previous studies have been devoted to finding the latent correspondence be\ntween image regions and words, e.g., connecting key words to specific regions of salient objects. Ho\nwever, existing methods are usually committed to handle concrete objects, rather than abstract ones,\n e.g., a description of some action,\r\nwhich in fact are also ubiquitous in description texts of real\n-world. The main challenge in dealing with abstract objects is that there is no explicit connections\n between them, unlike their concrete counterparts. One therefore has to alternatively find the impli\ncit and intrinsic connections between them. In this paper, we propose a relation-wise dual attention\n network (RDAN) for image-text matching. Specifically, we maintain an over-complete set that contain\ns pairs of regions and words. Then built upon this set, we encode the local correlations and the glo\nbal dependencies between regions and words by training a visual-semantic network. Then a dual pathwa\ny attention network is presented to infer the visual-semantic alignments and image-text similarity. \nExtensive experiments validate the efficacy of our method, by achieving the state-of-the-art perform\nance on several public benchmark datasets.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 0}, "806": {"title": "nuclei segmentation via a deep panoptic model with semantic feature fusion.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/121", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "618": {"title": "on the efficiency and equilibria of rich ads.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/43", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "820": {"title": "disparity-preserved deep cross-platform association for cross-platform video recommendation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/644", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "650": {"title": "automated machine learning with monte-carlo tree search.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/457", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "20": {"title": "modeling both context- and speaker-sensitive dependence for emotion detection in multi-speaker conversations.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/752", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "159": {"title": "submodular batch selection for training deep neural networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/372", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "58": {"title": "topology attack and defense for graph neural networks: an optimization perspective.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/550", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "341": {"title": "fine-grained event categorization with heterogeneous graph convolutional networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/449", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "251": {"title": "preferred deals in general environments.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/33", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "622": {"title": "failure-scenario maker for rule-based agent using multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning and its application to autonomous driving.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/832", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "306": {"title": "deep cascade generation on point sets.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/517", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "330": {"title": "merge-and-shrink task reformulation for classical planning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/783", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "87": {"title": "fast algorithm for k-truss discovery on public-private graphs.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/313", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "873": {"title": "semi-supervised user profiling with heterogeneous graph attention networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/293", "abstract": "Aiming to represent user characteristics and personal interests, the task of user profiling is playi\nng an increasingly important role for many real-world applications, e.g., e-commerce and social netw\norks platforms. By exploiting the data like texts and user behaviors, most existing solutions addres\ns user profiling as a classification task, where each user is formulated as an individual data insta\nnce.  Nevertheless, a user's profile is not only reflected from her/his affiliated data, but also ca\nn be inferred from other users, e.g., the users that have similar co-purchase behaviors in e-commerc\ne, the friends in social networks, etc. In this paper, we approach user profiling in a semi-supervis\ned manner, developing a generic solution based on heterogeneous graph learning. On the graph, nodes \nrepresent the entities of interest (e.g., users, items, attributes of items, etc.), and edges repres\nent the interactions between entities. Our heterogeneous graph attention networks (HGAT) method lear\nns the representation for each entity by accounting for the graph structure, and exploits the attent\nion mechanism to discriminate the importance of each neighbor entity. \r\nThrough such a learning sche\nme, HGAT can leverage both unsupervised information and limited labels of users to build the predict\nor. Extensive experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset verify the effectiveness and rationalit\ny of our HGAT for user profiling.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 0}, "531": {"title": "generative image inpainting with submanifold alignment.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/114", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "422": {"title": "learning interpretable deep state space model for probabilistic time series forecasting.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/402", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "719": {"title": "leveraging human guidance for deep reinforcement learning tasks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/884", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "589": {"title": "cutset bayesian networks: a new representation for learning rao-blackwellised graphical models.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/797", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "665": {"title": "outlier detection for time series with recurrent autoencoder ensembles.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/378", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "876": {"title": "embodied conversational ai agents in a multi-modal multi-agent competitive dialogue.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/940", "abstract": "In a setting where two AI agents embodied as animated humanoid avatars are engaged in a conversation\n with one human and each other, we see two challenges.

identifying malfunctions of systems. However, manually detecting ano\nmalies for logs is time-consuming, error-prone, and infeasible. Existing automatic log anomaly detec\ntion approaches, using indexes rather than semantics of log templates, tend to cause false alarms. I\nn this work, we propose LogAnomaly, a framework to model unstructured a log stream as a natural lang\nuage sequence. Empowered by template2vec, a novel, simple yet effective method to extract the semant\nic information hidden in log templates, LogAnomaly can detect both sequential and quantitive log ano\nmalies simultaneously, which were not done by any previous work. Moreover, LogAnomaly can avoid the \nfalse alarms caused by the newly appearing log templates between periodic model retrainings. Our eva\nluation on two public production log datasets show that LogAnomaly outperforms existing log-based an\nomaly detection methods.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 0}, "163": {"title": "faketables: using

could result in loss of life o\nr property if not handled properly. Detecting urban anomalies at the early stage is important to min\nimize the adverse effects. However, urban anomaly detection is difficult due to two challenges: a) t\nhe criteria of urban anomalies varies with different locations and time; b) urban anomalies of diffe\nrent types may show different signs. In this paper, we propose a decomposing approach to address the\nse two challenges. Specifically,\u00a0we decompose urban dynamics into the normal component and the abnor\nmal component. The normal component is merely decided by spatiotemporal features, while the abnormal\n component is caused by anomalous events. Then, we extract spatiotemporal features and estimate the \nnormal component accordingly. At last, we derive the abnormal component to identify anomalies.

Specifically, FDSA first integrates various heterogeneous features of items into\n feature sequences with different weights through a vanilla mechanism. After that, FDSA applies sepa\nrated self-attention blocks on item-level sequences and feature-level sequences, respectively, to mo\ndel item transition patterns and feature transition patterns.

to detect anomalous beats in an effective yet efficient way? For example, how can we dete\nct anomalous beats from electrocardiogram (ECG) readings? Existing approaches either require excessi\nvely high amounts of labeled and balanced data for classification, or rely on less regularized recon\nstructions, resulting in lower accuracy in anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose BeatGAN, an unsu\npervised anomaly detection algorithm for time series data. BeatGAN outputs explainable results to pi\nnpoint the anomalous time ticks of an input beat, by comparing them to adversarially generated beats\n. Its robustness is guaranteed by its regularization of reconstruction error using an adversarial ge\nneration approach, as well as data augmentation using time series warping. Experiments show that Bea\ntGAN accurately and efficiently detects anomalous beats in ECG time series, and routes doctors' atte\nntion to anomalous time ticks, achieving accuracy of nearly 0.95 AUC, and very fast inference (2.6 m\ns per beat). In addition, we show that BeatGAN accurately detects unusual motions from multivariate \nmotion-capture time series data, illustrating its generality.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 0}, "185": {"title": "using natural language for reward shaping in reinforcement learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/331", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "722": {"title": "decoding eeg by visual-guided deep neural networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/192", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "321": {"title": "noise-resilient similarity preserving network embedding for social networks.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/455", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "746": {"title": "on guiding search in htn planning with classical planning heuristics.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/857", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "577": {"title": "affine equivariant autoencoder.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/335", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "239": {"title": "on the integration of cp-nets in asprin.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/207", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "715": {"title": "graph-based neural sentence ordering.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/748", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "593": {"title": "variation generalized feature learning via intra-view variation adaptation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/116", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "347": {"title": "deep adversarial social recommendation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/187", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "959": {"title": "deep adversarial multi-view clustering network.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/409", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "32": {"title": "differentially private optimal transport: application to domain adaptation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/395", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "279": {"title": "a*+ida*: a simple hybrid search algorithm.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/168", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "234": {"title": "a deep bi-directional attention network for human motion recovery.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/99", "abstract": "Human motion capture (mocap) data, recording the movement of markers attached to specific joints, ha\ns gradually become the most popular solution of animation production.

Since human motion is essentially a se\nquential data, the latest methods resort to variants of long short-time memory network (LSTM) to sol\nve related problems, but most of them tend to obtain visually unreasonable results.

recommendation research has been concentrated on recommending single items to users, such as th\ne considerable work on collaborative filtering that models the interaction between a user and an ite\nm. However, in many real-world scenarios, the platform needs to show users a set of items, e.g., the\n marketing strategy that offers multiple items for sale as one bundle.In this work, we consider reco\nmmending a set of items to a user, i.e., the Bundle Recommendation task, which concerns the interact\nion modeling between a user and a set of items. We contribute a neural network solution named DAM, s\nhort for Deep Attentive Multi-Task model, which is featured with two special designs: 1) We design a\n factorized attention network to aggregate the item embeddings in a bundle to obtain the bundle's re\npresentation; 2) We jointly model user-bundle interactions and user-item interactions in a multi-tas\nk manner to alleviate the scarcity of user-bundle interactions. Extensive experiments on a real-worl\nd dataset show that DAM outperforms the state-of-the-art solution, verifying the effectiveness of ou\nr attention design and multi-task learning in DAM.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 0}, "868": {"title": "agent-based decision support for pain management in primary care settings.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/943", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "930": {"title": "margin learning embedded prediction for video anomaly detection with a few anomalies.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/419", "abstract": "Classical semi-supervised video anomaly detection assumes that only normal data are available in the\n training set because of the rare and unbounded nature of anomalies. It is obviously, however, these\n infrequently observed abnormal events can actually help with the detection of identical or similar \nabnormal events, a line of thinking that motivates us to study open-set supervised anomaly detection\n with only a few types of abnormal observed events and many normal events available. Under the assum\nption that normal events can be well predicted, we propose a Margin Learning Embedded Prediction (ML\nEP) framework. There are three features in MLEP- based open-set supervised video anomaly detection: \ni) we customize a video prediction framework that favors the prediction of normal events and distort\ns the prediction of abnormal events; ii) The margin learning framework learns a more compact normal \ndata distribution and enlarges the margin between normal and abnormal events. Since abnormal events \nare unbounded, our framework consequently helps with the detection of abnormal events, even for anom\nalies that have never been previously observed. Therefore, our framework is suitable for the open-se\nt supervised anomaly detection setting; iii) our framework can readily handle both frame-level and v\nideo-level anomaly annotations. Considering that video-level anomaly detection is more easily annota\nted in practice and that anomaly detection with a few anomalies is a more practical setting, our wor\nk thus pushes the application of anomaly detection towards real scenarios.

Since DNNs \nare well suitable for representation learning, they enable recommendation systems to generate more a\nccurate prediction. However, they inevitably result in high computational and storage costs. Worse s\ntill, due to the relatively small number of ratings that can be fed into DNNs, they may easily lead \nto over-fitting. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm based on Back\n Propagation (BP) neural network with Attention Mechanism (BPAM). In particular, the BP neural netwo\nrk is utilized to learn the complex relationship of the target users and their neighbors. Compared w\nith deep neural network, the shallow neural network, i.e., BP neural network, can not only reduce th\ne computational and storage costs, but also prevent the model from over-fitting.

In this paper, we aim to incorporate such s\negment information into neural relation extractor.

Indeed, due to the modal insufficiency in real-world applicat\nions, there are divergences among heterogeneous modalities. This imposes a critical challenge for mu\nlti-modal learning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Comprehensive Multi-Modal Learnin\ng (CMML) framework, which can strike a balance between the consistency and divergency modalities by \nconsidering the insufficiency in one unified framework.

Recent approaches model the conditional i\nntensity as a chain of recurrent neural networks to capture memory dependency in hopes of reducing t\nhe restrictions of the parametric form of the intensity function.

DVAN is a three-stage query-adaptive attention model. In order to acquire accurate A (answer\n), it first explores the textual attention, which imposes the question on history to pick out relate\nd context H'. Then, based on Q and H', it implements respective visual attentions to discover relate\nd global image visual hints Vg' and local object-based visual hints Vl'. Next, a dual crossing visua\nl attention is proposed. Vg' and Vl' are mutually embedded to learn the complementary of visual sema\nntics. Finally, the attended textual and visual features are combined to infer the answer.

Because attack payloads are often short segments hidden in URL reque\nsts/posts that can be very long, classical machine learning approaches have difficulties in learning\n useful patterns from them. In this study, we propose a novel Locate-Then-Detect (LTD) system that c\nan precisely detect Web threats in real-time by using attention-based deep neural networks. Firstly,\n an efficient Payload Locating Network (PLN) is employed to propose most suspicious regions from lar\nge URL requests/posts. Then a Payload Classification Network (PCN) is adopted to accurately classify\n malicious regions from suspicious candidates. In this way, PCN can focus more on learning malicious\n segments and highly increase detection accuracy. The noise induced by irrelevant background strings\n can be largely eliminated. Besides, LTD can greatly reduce computational costs (82.6% less) by igno\nring large irrelevant URL content. Experiments are carried out on both benchmarks and real Web traff\nic. The LTD outperforms an HMM-based approach, the Libinjection system, and a leading commercial rul\ne-based Web Application Firewall. Our method can be efficiently implemented on GPUs with an average \ndetection time of about 5ms and well qualified for real-time applications.\n\t\t    ", "cite_num": 0}, "912": {"title": "counterfactual regression with importance sampling weights.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/815", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "70": {"title": "rational inference relations from maximal consistent subsets selection.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/242", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "803": {"title": "crsrl: customer routing system using reinforcement learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/952", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "86": {"title": "personalized multimedia item and key frame recommendation.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/198", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "630": {"title": "out-of-sample node representation learning for heterogeneous graph in real-time android malware detection.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/576", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "685": {"title": "representation learning with weighted inner product for universal approximation of general similarities.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/699", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "84": {"title": "fully distributed bayesian optimization with stochastic policies.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/327", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "822": {"title": "optimally efficient bidirectional search.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/867", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "463": {"title": "prone: fast and scalable network representation learning.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/594", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "7": {"title": "learning interpretable relational structures of hinge-loss markov random fields.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/838", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "534": {"title": "group reconstruction and max-pooling residual capsule network.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/310", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "607": {"title": "prototype propagation networks (ppn) for weakly-supervised few-shot learning on category graph.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/418", "abstract": "", "cite_num": -1}, "521": {"title": "earlier attention? aspect-aware lstm for aspect-based sentiment analysis.", "conf": "ijcai", "time": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2019/738", "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict fine-grained sentiments of comments with resp\nect to given aspect terms or categories.

However, aspect-related information may be already discarded and aspect-irrelevant \ninformation may be retained in classic LSTM cells in the context modeling process, which can be impr\noved to generate more effective context representations. This paper proposes a novel variant of LSTM\n, termed as aspect-aware LSTM (AA-LSTM), which incorporates aspect information into LSTM cells in th\ne context modeling stage before the attention mechanism. Therefore, our AA-LSTM can dynamically prod\nuce aspect-aware contextual representations.
